While existing scholarship has treated the passage through the interior as a backdrop to the rebellion, I focus on the interior regions themselves, exploring how the country's so-called “backlands"" served as both a place and a concept in the formation of modern Brazil. By analyzing the rebel passage through the interior and also the meanings attached to that experience afterwards, I will chart the Column's political, conceptual, and geographic significance throughout the twentieth century.My study of the Prestes Column will also serve to develop an entirely new subfield: interior history, an innovative approach for studying Brazil and also Latin America as a whole."

For this reason, in the 1970s, the state turned to “rehabilitation” of citizens through labor camps, Soviet pedagogy designed to create a “Communist personality in every child” and finally, Fidel’s launch of the Mariel Boatlift in 1980—a policy to rid Cuba of critics accused of lacking “revolutionary genes”. What was it like to grow up in this Cuba? How did leaders go from “teaching the work of the Revolution” to repression and exclusion?  Through unused archives and oral history, I delve into the mechanisms through which grassroots support was constructed and challenged. Finding that the burdens of revolutionary citizenship often blurred lines, I illuminate an ironically apolitical nation within the binary of patriot vs. traitor: there, a creative, collective individualism thrived."

It argues: First, that voluntary self-control, which at times bled into self-sacrifice, was central to Gandhi’s utopian philosophy of sarvodaya; and second, that Gandhi’s intentional communities were the necessary conditions for his experiments with and articulation of that philosophy."

I contend that the fissures they created in scholarly and mainstream discourses about reproductive health functioned to expand the scope of infertility diagnosis and treatment regimens, and to loosen long-held clinical beliefs about women as the central players in fertility related ills. This analysis identifies the discursive strategies that these actors employed to intervene in fertility studies and demonstrates how interventions in science often unfold not in terms of revolutions but in terms of multimodal, nonlinear, and longitudinal communicative negotiations."

This project questions this perception through a study of the Iberian realms of León, Galicia, and Castile in the eleventh century, under Fernando I (1037-65) and Queen Sancha (d. 1067); it will be the first study of the reign in English. The period is often seen as one in which their Christian kingdom gained the upper hand over the weaker Islamic states of al-Andalus. Historians have generally believed that Fernando aspired to imperial authority in Iberia, developed a close relationship with the French monastic order of Cluny, and exerted dominance over the Islamic states to the south. This project challenges all these presumptions. Through an original analysis of royal charters and narrative sources, it traces the pragmatic nature of power and a geopolitical environment in which religious identity was by no means paramount."

Most importantly, who gets to decide what counts as a religion and what is a superstition – or a crime? My research, “Constructing Religion, Defining Crime: Slavery, Power and Belief,” examines how modern ideas about religion and freedom emerged within a colonial slave society. It shows how the institution of slavery made some religious practices criminal, while others were deemed legitimate. African diasporic religions were especially targeted for persecution and defined as rebellious. Examining this complex dynamic between race, belief, and danger shows that we must examine the history of slavery in order to understand the meaning of religion and the concept of religious freedom."

It unearths the permeability of law to novel modes of bringing suits, deciding verdicts, and enacting legal power. Across a geography that integrates South Asia, the Indian Ocean, Africa, and Europe, it charts transformations in colonial legal practice by analyzing judicial interactions that did not quite follow the letter of the law. It argues that French courts in the Indian Ocean relied on local modes of dispute resolution, even in jurisdictions that purportedly relied on European legal codes.

However, non-official realms of debt contracting and expansive British and French legal regimes threatened the Ottoman government’s claims to defining and legitimating credit and mortgage contracts.

the twentieth century tuberculosis epidemics in rural Alaska through the
conceptual framework of violence to connect the misery and suffering for many
that suffused these epidemics in such a way that “attends to the injustices of
history” (Evan and Carver 2017:3.), to make the case for what C. Wright Mills
referred to as linking private misery to public concerns (1959). What makes <em>To Die in the Silence of History</em> unique
is that it draws on comprehensive historical and ethnographic research to offer

Yet for all the work that has been done, there has been no full-length study of his actual writings on the topic in over a century, in part because of a popular myth about the rise of modern thought and science. Standard approaches to the history of the topic see a radical break between ancient and the modern thinking, and assume that ancient thinkers are working with radically different concepts than our own. This narrative has been shown to be false. We misinterpret ancient thinkers and misunderstand what is distinctive about our own ideas by making these assumptions. This project will establish a better interpretation of Aristotle’s theory of causation and its place in the study of nature. It will then use that interpretation to explore ways in which our thinking on these matters differs, and ways it might be improved."

This practice flouts critical but overlooked principles of political morality, principles concerning freedom of mind and the relationship between punishment and policing. Properly conceived, the controversy over thought crime is in fact just one battle in a larger war, a war fought on terrain common to many disciplines in the humanities.

Through the examination of court records, texts related to “legal literacy,” and debates over the statutes themselves, I argue that the courts in this period became a potent space in which representatives of the state and ordinary citizens clashed over new ideas about gender, bodily autonomy, social roles, and individual rights and civic responsibilities."

I explore the significant role played by these culturally layered art objects in mediating between India and France in the late eighteenth century, highlighting the role played by Mughal cultural legacies during this key phase of European colonial expansionism. Crucially, I emphasize the role played by art and artists in this process, restoring agency to Indian artists who have been rendered all but invisible in the historical record, and highlighting the centrality of images in processes of cultural exchange."

Second, this is not a traditional anthropological ethnography, but one that integrates archival research with analysis of secondary newspaper and academic sources, and oral histories and interviews. Third, rather than a historical biography, it is more aptly described as an ethnography of the shifting terrain of the model minority discourse during the Cold War, focusing on a family that was at the center of the media attention, and exploring the continuing effects of this discourse as it circulated. I examine how it has been re-narrated to reflect current generations’ desired interpretations of their own history and future trajectory."

We often attribute the growth of religious toleration in early modern Europe to the Enlightenment, as radical intellectuals invented novel justifications for toleration that eventually spread to the population at large. My project emphasizes the importance of violent conflict, rather than comity and curiosity, in driving toleration forward. Early modern Europe had a fiercely competitive state system, and toleration offered key advantages, especially in military affairs. Rulers granted liberties to religious minorities as a way of enlisting their support in military conflicts. Geopolitical instability and the inclusion of minorities often went hand in hand: toleration spread across Europe not because states sought to abandon violent warfare, but because they embraced it."

Through an ethnographic reading of the archives of illegal slavery, this project weaves together the past and present, historical characters and archival encounters to propose a new way of writing about the ambiguous histories of slavery and freedom that centers the suffering and afterlives of the enslaved."

Taking advantage of Taiwan's cultural and geographical proximity to China and Southeast Asia, Japanese colonial authorities in Taiwan developed new strategies to compete with Chinese and Western powers for hegemony across the East and South China seas. Drawing on multi-lingual archives across six countries, this project contends that Japanese imperial ideas and practices were not simply dictated by the Tokyo central government but also emanated from Taiwan to its neighboring regions.

than from the uneven distribution of noise across different periods, genres,

research and discourages some scholars from using digital libraries at all. To
address these problems, we will 1) Create paired libraries of clean, manually
transcribed volumes and optically-transcribed versions of the same volumes,

Because of the low socio-economic population the library serves, the need for exposure to the humanities is critical for individuals to recognize their own dreams and potential through the study of literary characters and historical figures who overcame struggles before them. Hence, the new multifaceted spaces proposed by the McMorrough Library Renovation Project for Cultivating the Humanities will secure practical activities set forth as well as advance the library to become an innovative leader among Mississippi’s fifteen public community colleges."

It takes an object-based method for data collection instead of a pigment-based organization scheme. By developing a database model that can normalize fragmentary and uneven data, MCH will help scholars to bring together disparate data that is difficult to find or compare.

GIS has served as the dominant platform, but its core paradigm – that historical data should be layered and often stretched (georectified) to fit modern Cartesian cartography – is particularly problematic for scholars who study medieval and early modern maps and views. Our solution proposes a workflow that integrates GIS, CAD, and the Unity game engine to build a malleable mapping environment that forgoes the concept of historical layers in favor of linked views that allow simultaneous navigation among original sources, modern cartography, and virtual landscapes. Using work already begun on a 16th-century Portuguese chorography known as the Book of Fortresses as our primary and initial case study, this ”Sandcastle Workflow” proposes a method for confronting a range of pre-modern spatial idiosyncrasies that GIS alone has proven incapable of visualizing."

It will address controversies surrounding Vishniac, including recent debates about the authenticity of some of his photographs. It will reveal the ruptures in the family because of his flamboyant, often difficult personality. Finally, the film will frame Vishniac’s legacy as a key modernist photographer and preserver of memory. Vishniac’s collection is vast, unexpected, and causes us to step back in time. Through his iconic images, the film will expose new audiences to a lost world that is quickly fading from our grasp."

Organized by MAM and the Chrysler Museum of Art (CMA), the exhibition is currently scheduled to travel to two venues. Curators at both museums have worked closely with esteemed scholars to examine an underexplored moment in history when many of America’s most prominent artists traveled to Spain for training. Americans in Spain focuses on a time when both countries were undergoing significant shifts in power, culture, and worldviews. The exhibition sheds light on the how the political, economic, and cultural conditions affected how the artists experienced Spain and shaped their work. This close look at the artists’ sojourns brings light to an understudied aspect of American art and provides a rich opportunity to expand the understanding of American visual culture."

Based on newly discovered poll lists and using original objects, digital interactives, and physical environments, the exhibition asks what new possibilities the Revolution created for women’s political activism. It explains how hope faltered amid rising partisanship, racism, and class tension as New Jersey closed the vote to all but propertied white men in 1807, yet, also how the Revolutionary promise rose again a generation later as suffragists drew inspiration from these early women voters. Timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the passage of women’s suffrage, the exhibition encourages visitors to consider that progress is not always linear, but that preserving rights and liberties requires constant vigilance.<br />

My book, Qur’anic Stories: God, Revelation and the Audience, remedies this gap by developing a methodology to analyze qur’anic stories, given their dual status as narratives that are religious, and analyzes a few qur’anic stories in order to explore the Qur’an’s use of narrative technique to reinforce theological beliefs.

Before the Civil War, the federal government played almost no role in immigration. National laws regulating the movement of one kind of people (immigrants) would have affected the movement of others (free black and slaves). The states set their own terms for the admission, exclusion, and expulsion of foreigners, and for the movement of free blacks and enslaved persons. Only after slavery was abolished did the Supreme Court rule unequivocally that immigration was a federal matter. By this time, the Chinese were subject to the kinds of racial practices that had been used against free blacks in the antebellum era. To justify Chinese exclusion, the Supreme Court ruled in 1889 that federal authority over immigration resided in the inherent sovereignty of the nation, rather than any particular part of the Constitution. This doctrine has been the basis of U.S. immigration policy ever since."

Her key philosophical innovation was to argue that freedom for women requires that they choose what she calls “the neutral life,” foreswearing personal and professional relationships. I offer the first systematic treatment of Suchon’s philosophical system, showing how it offers new, feminist perspective on early modern treatments of human freedom. By placing Suchon in the context of feminist thought, I join the larger scholarly tradition, led by feminist historians, of giving women their proper place in intellectual history."

This project argues that Lincoln serves as a synthesis of Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian ideas. Lincoln's thought marries Jefferson's preference for self-sufficient labor and natural rights to Hamilton's belief in a national economic policy and skepticism of Jeffersonian populism.  Looking at each statesman's views on economics, presidential power, war, the Constitution, natural rights, and populism we see that Lincoln was able to blend ideas of both founders to build better than either intended. As the nature of the founding-era conflicts still inhabit contemporary politics, we can prosper from appreciating Lincoln's fusion of the best of Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian ideas."

I hypothesize that: 1) Interpretations of the flu varied between urban/rural contexts and across national/confessional lines. 2) Rural communities placed greater trust in local leaders than in overburdened national authorities. 3) In contrast to modern Europeans’ dependency on a welfare state, rural Europeans in 1918 had fewer expectations that governments were responsible for citizens’ health, which enhanced social stability during the crisis."

The US government’s wartime decision to abolish slavery without reimbursing slaveowners for the lost value of freed slaves threatened to send this complex system of finance, founded on human property, into chaos. From 1864-1871, southern and federal lawmakers and judges, as well as everyday southerners, argued over who ought to be responsible for the financial burden of emancipation. This project explores the little-known history of white southerners’ defense of their perceived right to own slaves or to be reimbursed for their value. Their debates, ranging from former Confederate states to the US Capital, reveal that immediate, uncompensated emancipation in the US South was not an inevitable outcome of Union victory in the Civil War, and the process of emancipation extended well beyond the abolition of slavery."

This meaning-making process is used as a model by black communities today that mobilize around the food justice movement.

My thesis is that such middlebrow institutions have served as sites where the boundaries of the American public have been contested and where demands for fuller public participation by marginalized groups have repeatedly been tested. The first three chapters focus on programs that shaped the reading public around Shakespeare. The last two chapters suggest that Shakespeare’s reading public now emphasizes some of the same constituents it once excluded, demonstrating that Shakespeare’s uses are changing even as he remains a vehicle for American aspirations."

Worn down by years of violence and deprivation, native peoples gradually submitted to Spanish rule in the late 1580s, agreeing to resettlement in reducciones (reservations) near Spanish towns. The focus on state peoples and events casts Iberians and sedentary indigenous migrants from central Mexico as the main subjects of this foundational borderlands history. This book recovers and repositions Chichimecas as central protagonists. It considers how they experienced the war, took an active role in peacemaking, responded to social reorganization in reducciones, and navigated the state’s attempts to transform their lifeways."

This posed a problem, I argue, in that the template internalized the logic of Boston’s postwar urban renewal campaign, which mingled cultural heritage with profit, private investment, and racial erasure.  My work demonstrates that, despite resistance from within the agency and among its stakeholders, decisions made over a half century ago in Boston about the role and purpose of history account in part for the unfortunate state of public history in the NPS today."

It was also one of the most controversial in that it precipitated horrific mass reprisals that led to the deaths of approximately 5,000 people. “Heydrich’s Shadow” explores the curious transformation in the Czech lands of the memory of the killing of Heydrich. Whereas in 1942 and for years thereafter the assassination was widely understood as a reckless and ill-conceived endeavor, by the 1990s it came to be celebrated as the single most important act of Czech resistance. This book project traces the surprising shifts in the interpretation of the assassination under Nazi, Communist, and liberal democratic rule, suggesting that “memory” is best understood as an unstable framework of meaning."

Only during the First World War did the firms’ land tenure arrangements in parts of Greater Syria and Palestine begin to take on a commodified form, making them acceptable to European buyers.

Although now largely forgotten, Boyle was among the foremost chroniclers of the twentieth century's darkest days, documenting and analyzing in her fiction the rise of Nazism in Austria in the mid-1930s, the fall of France and the internment of innocent refugees during WWII, and America's occupation of post-war Germany, which still struggled to free itself from fascism. Boyle’s fiction in the 1930s-1940s won her two O. Henry Awards for best story of the year and a contract with The New Yorker that was severed in 1953 when she was erroneously accused of being a Communist. This book will illuminate Boyle’s considerable contributions to international modernism and anti-fascist literature. Most importantly, Kay Boyle’s life and work can help us look more closely at the troubling times we now confront."

This project provides an alternative understanding of the early Renaissance, identifying ties between the demographic situation and the literary and artistic production of the time. Two ongoing concerns underscore the research: changes in female agency and modifications of social behavior in response to anxieties about fertility and population decline. By identifying the historical events that connect the concepts of human and intellectual fertility, it unveils the link between female reproductive duties and the iconography of childbirth, between family books and the anxiety of perpetuating the family name; between monumental state commissions and the public trauma of depopulation."

This book explores this paradox by examining the controversial public presence of concubines and its multifaceted social and cultural consequences in an age when reformists had launched vehement attacks on concubinage. It argues that these women should not be evaluated as merely members of an outdated social category waiting to be eliminated but were a key group of controversial women who were often at the center of intense public debates about China’s imperial past and its Republican future. By showing how concubines’ public visibility intricately connected elite men’s private lives to national politics, the book provides new insights on how gender functioned in important yet overlooked ways in the progressive politics of the Republic."

Previous studies have overlooked the intense visuality of these works—they are packed with illustrations, rhetorical allusions to the visual arts, and descriptions of visual images. “Postcolonial Modernism and the Visual Book” examines the early years of decolonization to show that postcolonial writers in this period transformed modernism in the visual arts and used it to decolonize English literature. I study the collaboration of African, Caribbean, and British writers and artists and show how crossing disciplinary boundaries was crucial to undoing the colonial systems of knowledge and representation that underpin literary history and form."

However, the rationalist justification of democracy is questioned by two major sources: first, by influential voices in late modern Continental political philosophy; second, by recent research in the field of American political science. On both fronts, a similar claim is made: namely, that liberal democratic political theory has failed to recognize that human beings are primarily “rationalizing” beings, rather than “reasoning” beings. I believe that political theorists need to take this claim seriously, so that we can consider with fresh eyes the question: to what extent are genuinely “rational” citizens required in order to have a properly functioning liberal democracy?"

Throughout the 1800s, virtually all long works
of fiction by American writers featured first-person narration—an “I” or a “we”
telling the tale to the reader. But by the early years of the twentieth
century, an impersonal or “third-person” style of narration had become the
norm, and the appearance of the first-person “I” was deemed an offensive
authorial intrusion. Reading nineteenth-century American novelists
as members of a single family allows me to portray these narrative techniques
as a social project, developed among a community of readers and writers, rather
than as a series of isolated individual discoveries. “The First Person in
America” presents a literary history that connects the early preoccupation with
a democratic or private interiority, with the later development of an imperial
or corporate self. (Edited by staff)"

Arguing that these attitudes misrepresent the history of Judaism, Rabbinic Inferno: Hell in Classical Judaism produces the first scholarly book on afterlife retribution in the rabbinic era (70-700 CE). Rather than absent in classical Jewish discourse, or occupying its periphery, hell played a central role in classical Jewish literature and culture. Rabbinic Inferno uses ancient Jewish discourse about hell -- as it emerges in rabbinic biblical interpretation -- to unearth the distinctive anxieties, values, aesthetics, fantasies, and hopes within classical Jewish culture. Without such analysis, our understanding of Judaism remains incomplete."

The U.S. military’s approach was utilitarian and centered on logistics. Over the period of the crisis, however, military personnel came to know both Kosovar refugees and surrounding Albanian communities and adjusted their approach to better fit the needs of refugees and communities. Albanian communities and local governments, meanwhile, turned to the historic concept of <em>mikpritja </em>(hospitality) to understand why and how to help the Kosovar refugees, ultimately motivating Albanian families to shelter sixty-six percent of all refugees. This study provides insight into two very different approaches to mass migration and, as a result, gestures towards the rich potential of looking beyond the standard narratives of humanitarian aid and refugee assistance."

I argue that ancient idolatry polemic produced both the idols spoken of and several assumptions that still govern modern Biblical Studies: that something called “biblical religion” existed; that the Bible contains a single, clear concept of idolatry; that idolatry is only about the erroneous treatment of images; and that ancient Jewish and Christian worship was scrupulously observant of the second commandment. A close reading of ancient Jewish, Christian, and “pagan” texts, however, shows that these assumptions are as misleading as they are intuitive. The project I propose here is to draft two new chapters (on “biblical religion” and early Christian worship) to orient what will become my first book, ""Idol Talk: False Worship in the Early Christian World."""

Rather than solely focusing on the actions of the central state, this project shows in detail how white officials, royal family members, and prominent Zulu leaders negotiated the project of <em>bantustan </em>“state building” and the codification of legal boundaries of Zulu ethnicity.

At this time, South Koreans preachers, politicians, military officials, martyrs, widows, and orphans were indispensable for the transpacific re-birth of US evangelicalism. As the lesser ally, South Koreans were the objects of US Orientalist fears and desires.

The project shows the role of collective storytelling in interrogating, imagining, and performing belonging to the Philippine nation-state. The documentation of stories allows us to think of migrant and refugee communities as active producers of knowledge and not just objects of study. Preserving these narratives is the bedrock of future research on underrepresented groups, especially as they simultaneously validate and disrupt dominant narratives."

Aeroflot’s dramatic growth from an undeveloped sector under Stalin to the “world’s largest airline” under Brezhnev tells the broader but still little understood story of the Soviet Union’s postwar transformation from an inward-looking terror state focused on industrial production to a superpower that wagered its legitimacy on fulfilling consumer needs at home and establishing a formidable global presence abroad. By examining Aeroflot as a microcosm of the Soviet system, my project explains the country’s broader, sustained growth in the postwar era as the result of the state’s successful attempts to create a consumer-oriented, but not consumer-driven economy, propelled by technological development, global expansion, and the legitimizing discourse of Marxist-Leninist ideology."

In my book, <em>Taste Maker</em> (under contract with Signal Press), I present a narrative biography—the first on Jones (based, in part, on extensive oral history interviews I conducted with Jones in 2013, as well as on exclusive access to her personal archive)—examining her extraordinary life, and in so doing, parsing the role of women in American publishing, the under-documented role of editors in literature, and the “quiet power of cookbooks.”"

Sacred Embryology is one of the most important Enlightenment-era texts on fetal personhood in the Catholic world. It inspired more than a century of similar works, abridgements, and translations. These works were widely distributed, especially throughout Latin America. It also directly influenced the Catholic Church’s position on fetal ensoulment, as articulated in Pius IX’s 1869 Apostolicae Sedis. With this text, Cangiamila became one of the first theologians—and certainly the most vocal of his time—to insist that fetal ensoulment might occur as early as conception.

We argue that the Asylum’s place in professional and lay understandings of mental illness, social exclusion and silences in family genealogies, theories and practices of early modern healthcare, populations of public psychiatric institutions, and post-emancipation racial understanding has been understudied or unknown. We are thus requesting NEH funding to support research time and the costs of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating information about the Asylum."

I tracked  how the virtue of humility came to be denigrated as the vice of humiliation.

to catalog, safely preserve, and make accessible the extensive documentary
materials assembled by linguists and anthropologists, mainly with Uto-Aztecan
and Yuman languages. Included are well over 500 sound recordings and over 100
field notebooks from more than a dozen languages. We will catalog and preserve
these materials; digitize the sound recordings, field notebooks, and other key
items; and provide online access as appropriate through the California Language
Archive (CLA). The second goal is to explore collaborative co-curation of CLA
content by expanding a new prearchive process to facilitate community-based
metadata creation, cultural knowledge labeling, and recommendations for access.
Members of three indigenous communities will work with us to identify contents,
participants, and key contexts of newly accessioned and digitized materials;
provide cultural knowledge labels; and advise us on appropriate levels of
public access."

The result was an outpouring of creativity that continues to this day as artists find innovative ways to express their worldview across cultures.

Our museum houses the bulk of archaeological materials excavated within Detroit, and includes major collections from the British (1760-1796) and American (1796-present) periods of the city, with more limited materials from earlier French and Indigenous periods. These collections reflect a shift from a small fur trade community into a thriving agricultural region, and then an industrial metropolis. Of particular significance as we prepare to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution are the well preserved architectural materials from Fort Lernoult, built by the British in Detroit in 1779."

Realist landscapes by British artist John Constable (1776-1837) are often split into two phases depending on whether they were made before or after an intense period spent observing and painting clouds in 1821-1822. Contemporaries disagreed about the effect this interlude had on the realism of his work, and art historians continue to debate how his empirical approach influenced his style and technique. The project team will use computer vision to seek formal details that art historians may have overlooked or been unable to discern. We will also use machine learning to discover whether there are formal features that contribute to the verisimilitude of three different types of pictorial realism: Constable’s paintings of clouds, fine art photographs of clouds, and research photographs of clouds made for scientific study."

For black Americans, the war was about not only America’s standing in the world but also about how much actual freedom would exist in the United States.  Black troops were at Normandy, Iwo Jima, and the Battle of the Bulge.  They fought bravely in combat, and they formed the backbone of the United States military’s supply effort, enabling the Allies to fight and win a global war.  They did all of this while fighting in a segregated military.  Black veterans returned from the war and kept fighting white supremacy at home, fueling the civil rights movement.  This history is important because more than seventy years later the questions the war raised regarding race and democracy remain unanswered. This book tells this inspiring and troubling story of bravery and patriotism in the face of unfathomable racism."

Centering on all-important social issues like the sanctity of the family, the significance of reputation, and the range of acceptable expressions of gender, the trial challenged long-held beliefs of an American populace still searching for moral consensus after the shattering divisiveness of civil war. And although the spectacle of the trial dominated front pages nationwide, its outcome was of critical importance to the city in which the drama played out—San Francisco, a still-adolescent metropolis in the 1870s, eager to shed its Gold Rush-era reputation as a raucous and untamed frontier town. My book will recount this story of surprisingly modern cultural conflicts and explore what it meant—both for a nation still scarred by war and for the rapidly growing city that hoped to take its rightful place in it."

This was a world, or landscape, with shared assumptions about the role that divine beings played in their lives and the practices and techniques that could be used to get these beings to help, even if these practices often had distinctive, superficial, markings of religious or ethnic identity. I will focus on the lived religion, the quotidian interactions between ordinary beings and supernatural agents, that was a pervasive and embedded part of everyone's life.

Women in her generation, which included both housewives and career women, turned to Fu because she taught them how to cook an astounding range of unfamiliar Chinese regional dishes on their television sets, in ways their own mothers and grandmothers never could. As her fame grew, Fu and her cookbooks traveled beyond the borders of Taiwan, teaching the rest of the world how to cook Chinese food. Fu’s story offers a way to examine a much more personal and intimate set of concerns about food, family, gender roles, and cultural identity. This is not a story of timeless tradition, but of modern transformation—of self and family, of cuisine and society."

How did early modern poets, theologians, and--above all--visual artists articulate their sense of wonder, hope, and anxiety before the ineffable spectacle of the celestial dome? Rather than focusing on the scientific sky of astronomers and physicists to come, Liquid Sky will explore the abstract, puzzling, and volatile sky--at once beautiful and devastating--in the period between Dante’s imagining of paradise and Galileo’s portrait of starry messengers. The project will consider the sky: as chaos and dialectic; as an extension of the artist’s palette; as a cause for wonder and for anxiety; as chromatic instability; and as a marker of time."

Despite this, there has been little in-depth writing on it. This work presents the first comprehensive history of <em>Sullivan</em>.

Since George’s life spanned the revolutionary era, his story offers a counterpoint to the many biographies of America’s white founders. Instead of typical narratives about political freedom from British monarchy, George’s life presents a parallel quest for freedom from American slavery. To achieve his own independence, George fled the U.S. at its creation. As the NEH looks toward the 250th anniversary of American independence, David George offers a vantage point on the lines of exclusion that limited liberty in the new nation, while also providing an inspiring story of an enslaved man’s quest for the ideal that “all men are created equal.”"

These women could carry a fetus to term, but could not give birth naturally. In such cases, obstetricians had three options: to stand by as both mother and child died; to save the mother by destroying the fetus in utero and delivering it in pieces; or to perform a Caesarean section, which was tantamount to a death sentence for the mother. Thus, medical professionals were forced to weigh the life of the mother against the life of the unborn child, whose value was as yet unknown; and the mother’s own disability was, itself, a factor in this calculus. This project explores representations of these cases in literary and medical discourse; in the new discipline of statistical analysis; and in Victorian medical photography."

Initially, the only credible motive for church authorities to disturb a Christian body was if s/he was a saint destined for a better resting place. A punitive exhumation was anathema because it implied posthumous judgment: Peter was given the power to bind and loose the living, not the dead. This ancient rationale was reversed ca. 1100 when Pope Paschal II exhumed his rival, the antipope Clement III. Soon exhumations were visited upon heretics and excommunicates posthumously condemned, usurers, and even debtors. Such disinterments represent the church’s growing hegemony over the dead; an inversion of the translation of saints; a ritual of forgetting; and an impetus for lay resistance."

In focusing on the words and lives of sufferers, as well as a particularly vocal group of clap-curers who lived and worked in the crowded streets of London, the book is intended to appeal to a broad audience. I use accessible prose and human stories, but without sacrificing the rigor of thoughtful scholarship.

""Visual culture” is defined as art objects, including photomontage, sculpture, painting, book art, and film, as well as more mundane visual forms, such as posters, flags and uniforms, and magazine illustrations. Led by art historian Natasha Goldman, PhD, and historian Page Herrlinger, PhD, participants will be introduced to teaching and viewing this topic through the visual lens and be encouraged to share their own teaching experiences and how they have confronted the challenges unique to the visual legacy of the Holocaust and genocide."

Garcia examines the work of figures ranging from Melville J. Herskovits, Katherine Dunham, and Asadata Dafora to Duke Ellington, Dámaso Pérez Prado, and others who believed that linking black music and dance with Africa and nature would help realize modernity’s promises of freedom in the face of fascism and racism in Europe and the Americas, colonialism in Africa, and the nuclear threat at the start of the Cold War. In analyzing their work, Garcia traces how such attempts to link black music and dance to Africa unintentionally reinforced the binary relationships between the West and Africa, white and black, the modern and the primitive, science and magic, and rural and urban."

Through analysis of its carefully crafted illustrations and their allied texts, I show how the Bible could have shaped not only the young baron's faith but also his political and social aspirations and worldview, as well as his memory, emotions, and masculinity. My project sheds new light on the history of Bible translation and reception; the roles of images in mediating Scripture; women's cultural patronage; medieval ideas about gender, health, and sexuality; and English art, society, and culture after the Black Death."

Close examination of these deed records, in the City of St. Louis and in suburban St. Louis County, will provide a detailed account of the use of deed restrictions (in new subdivisions and older neighborhoods alike), of their importance in inventing and sustaining racial segregation, and of the lasting impact of that segregation on local housing, wealth, and economic opportunity.

The proposed project argues, in contrast, that many early rabbinic authorities did not immediately embrace the biblical text as a source of religious knowledge when the Bible was first canonized but were instead deeply ambivalent about the biblical text and uneasy about its status as a written document. Drawing primarily on less frequently analyzed late antique Palestinian rabbinic texts, this project paints a portrait of early Judaism in which religious leaders seldom opened a Bible and even elite religious thinkers might maintain an indistinct notion of the contents of the biblical text."

The work is situated in three locales, joined by the commercial circuits of the textile industry: Ottoman Syria (Homs, Hama, Mount Lebanon); New England (Lowell, Lawrence, Boston); and Brazil (Sao Paulo). The emergence of Syrian communities in these towns was complemented by the liquidity of labor among them, and Syrian workers (men and women) circulated the Americas in pursuit of higher wages. Whether in Brazil or Boston, Syria or Sao Paulo, Arab textile workers communicated across oceans to strike better working conditions for themselves, developing a cosmopolitan outlook that was authentically working-class."

The period represents arguably the liveliest era of medieval scholasticism, and the topic is of great intrinsic interest for both the history of religion and the history of philosophy (as Christology was both shaped by, and shaped, Ockham’s nominalist semantics). But it also provides invaluable background to the Christological debates of the Reformation, which were heavily influenced by nominalism. The project will also cast light on the events surrounding the condemnation of Jan Hus, including a somewhat obscure proposition from his Christology, at the Council of Constance in 1415."

Third, I argue that we can better understand the achievements of African American authors of the Harlem Renaissance by reading their work as being in dialogue and contestation with the Post’s white authors, and with Jim Crow modernism more broadly. Ultimately, my project provides a greater understanding of the constructions of blackness that dominated American print culture, and an enhanced contextualization of the literature of the Harlem Renaissance."

Drawing from nearly 3,000 sources, my research documents the myriad ways that Euro-Americans, Native Americans, and African Americans have related to this charismatic reptile over the past two centuries: not only as a terrifying predator, but also a landscape symbol, commodity, trophy, mascot, pet, totem, endangered species, nuisance, and sentinel species. I show how humans have shaped this apex predator, even as culture strongly inflects how we perceive it. When we peer into the eyes of an alligator, what we see reflected back is as much a product of our preconceptions and fears as the unvarnished reality of the creature that stands before us."

A New History of Asian American Literature” is a scholarly monograph and

Its focus is the 1974 publication of <em>Aiiieeeee!</em>,
a canonical and deeply controversial Asian American literary anthology. Read
widely and reviewed everywhere from The New Yorker to Rolling Stone, <em>Aiiieeeee!</em> was the first – and remains
the only – Asian American literary anthology to achieve the status of trade
publication rather than an academic one primarily for classroom use. The
monograph, based on archival research of an enormous collection of previously
inaccessible documents, demonstrates how Asian American literature of the
post-WW2 period intersected with countercultural energies and US-Asian military
conflicts of the 1970s to create new modes of writing and reading about what it
meant to be a racial minority in America."

It traces the kidnapping of freed people across jurisdictions, from Philadelphia to St. Domingo or Barbados to Texas. It argues that when black people crossed in and out of jurisdictions, and in and out of slavery, it prompted a reckoning with what freedom meant. As captives pushed for an end to their bondage abroad, they expanded the freedom struggle onto foreign terrain. Remarkably, captives could at times enlist high ranking officials as allies. When statesmen in Washington D.C. or London responded to freedom suits, they developed conceptions of what it meant to be a free subject of an empire. Carried Back demonstrates that freedom, and the rights it encompassed, came not just from elite politicians, and not only from people who resided within national or imperial borders. Black people who were carried across international boundaries also came to be central actors in the history of abolition."

Reckoning with the cultural work of the slum imaginary can help to disentangle actionable facts about the dwelling-places of the poor from the myriad other associations that continue to be affectively interwoven with those facts in the imagination of urban poverty."

It offers a new line of inquiry that uncovers a neglected period of the movement when activists expanded the meaning of civil rights to address food, and control over access to food, as integral to social and economic conditions. This meaning-making process is used as a model by black communities today that mobilize around the food justice movement. By making these connections, my book brings together histories of civil rights with food justice studies to illuminate the connections between civil rights activism and present-day food justice activism in rural black communities in the Delta."

Because the prospect of fellow humans starving to death is so disturbing, famines generate intense discussion of a given culture’s ultimate values.  Yet conceptions of what ethical responses to famine entail are neither static nor universal.  China experienced radical change between the late-Qing (1800-1912), Republican (1912-49) and Maoist (1949-76) periods. I examine how such change impacted state and societal responses to the North China Famine of 1876-79, the Henan Famine of 1942-43, and the Great Leap Famine of 1958-62.  I find that in twentieth-century China, the rejection of long-held cosmological interpretations of famine made it easier for the state to engineer disasters in the name of a supposedly greater good, and harder for leaders to accept blame for and relieve calamities."

Lesotho had become the world’s first water-exporter. As water rose in national importance, however, its very nature came into question, inciting debates about how it flows across the landscape. Conservation experts worry that soil erosion and reservoir sedimentation might imperil this massive water project. They blame rural livestock owners who turned to livestock production in the absence of mining jobs. Rural people, by contrast, blame soil erosion on climate change, citing increased drought and destructive thunderstorms. In effect, Lesotho’s water-export economy has exposed a crisis of environmental interpretation. My research scrutinizes this debate, showing why humanistic insights are crucial to emergent water regimes in the Anthropocene."

My project thus delineates the evolving modernity of a major non-Western urban theatre field, connecting it to sociocultural shifts in India and to vital movements in world theatre."

In <em>No Cheating! A Spinozistic Reading of Early Modern Metaphysics</em>, I offer a new account of the philosophical threat of Spinozism by showing how central views in early modern metaphysics tended toward Spinozistic conclusions in significant ways. From Spinoza’s vantage point, early moderns responded to this threat by cheating: they fail to follow through on their own principles solely for the sake of avoiding Spinozistic conclusions. Even worse, their blocking maneuvers lead to metaphysical views that are less philosophically stable than the dreaded alternative. Such cheating isn’t just unseemly—it is philosophically costly. In addition to shedding fresh light on the power and scope of Spinoza’s own philosophical vision, this project helps us better understand alternative early modern views by seeing their pressure points and possible defenses from this Spinozistic perspective."

How has the writing and performance of poetry acted as a religious practice? What concepts of religion emerge when we view poetic production in terms of religious practice? How are these questions weighted when the poems and the religious practices around which they developed come from a past culture, one radically different from the contemporary context in which we ask them? Taking Syriac poetry itself as its subject, this is the first study to integrate these questions into a broader account of eastern Christian literature as a distinctive phenomenon."

Because Jews were distinctive not only in belief and practice, but in kinship ties and occupational patterns, they complicated southern racial and religious norms. When viewed through the lens of its Jewish residents, the South emerges as a place not only of rural spaces, rigid racial divisions, and Christian uniformity, but of urban settings, shifting dynamics of inclusion and exclusion, and diverse people groups laying claim to southern belonging.

Lineages anchored their control of village-level environments to graves and shrines. They endowed land to corporations held in the name of their ancestors, and used fengshui geomancy to govern the vegetation and landforms permitted in discrete segments of the village landscape. Most importantly, they used the framework of patrilineal descent to determine who was permitted access to shared resources. Far from eternal features of the Chinese environment, village landscapes were created through repeated interactions between people and their natal soils and waters, flora and fauna, governed by a coherent ethics joining kinship and ecology."

Property ownership was central to Black visions of freedom following emancipation. But racist practices, invisible obstacles, and hidden traps made it difficult for them to hang on to their property. Of these, few were more powerful, or more quietly destructive, than the property tax. This project shows how discriminatory over-assessment of Black-owned property and manipulation of tax delinquency laws by local officials and private investors fueled Black land loss and shaped the landscape of racial inequality in 20th century America. It also shows how Blacks fought for fair and equitable tax laws and their rights as taxpayers and citizens."

It was also one of the most controversial in that it precipitated horrific mass reprisals that led to the deaths of approximately 5,000 people. The Afterlife of a Death explores the curious transformation in the Czech lands of the memory of the killing of Heydrich. Whereas in 1942 and for years thereafter the assassination was widely understood as a reckless and ill-conceived endeavor, by the 1990s it came to be celebrated as the single most important act of Czech resistance. This book project traces the shifts in its interpretation under Nazi, Communist, and liberal democratic rule, suggesting that what is commonly termed “memory” is better understood as the social framework of meaning."

Paradoxically, as the town braced itself every ten years for a new plague event and faced the threat of societal extinction, it also became the center of artistic innovation. The study suggests an innovative approach that analyzes how art mediates and reflects modifications of social behavior as a response to stress and population decline. The link between human and intellectual fertility unveils not only a connection between female reproductive duties and the iconography of childbirth, but also between art, literature and the public trauma caused by depopulation."

Simultaneously, artistic production reached unprecedented growth leading to decades of art that gained international attention but have yet to be critically researched. How did the social-historical context lead to experimentation in art that responds to violence, memory, migration, and diaspora?

Analyzing these individual struggles within the context of public debates over women’s and children’s rights, my book reveals ground-level dynamics of major paradigm shifts in the legal conception of the family as it shifted from what legal scholars identify as “the patriarchal, patrimonial model,” shaped by nineteenth-century liberalism, to the “egalitarian and pluralistic model” that emerged from anti-authoritarian movements of the late twentieth century."

Drawing upon literary, epigraphic, and visual evidence to contextualize Thucydides’ account, I show that he advanced an understanding of dêmokratia that was substantively different from later definitions of “democracy.” Paradoxical though it seems, he impressed upon his reader the need to analyze Athenian democracy as a form of autocratic rule, not as an inherently egalitarian regime. In doing so, I show, Thucydides reinvented the traditional ideology of heroic kingship, utilizing explanatory tools from Greek science to produce an account of a heroic democracy that was at once proto-social scientific and indebted to tragic myth. Recognition of this project redefines our understanding of Thucydidean thought and suggests an understanding of “democracy” that challenges present orthodoxy in both democratic theory and intellectual history."

Through close analysis of the biblical text and archaeological evidence from ancient Israel, the project examines the rituals of childbirth and considers their role in creating and sustaining the ancient family. It also examines the ways in which different biblical writers draw upon the rituals of the family in order to articulate their own ideas about the relationship between God and the Israelites.

With each, how did inhabitants and newcomers -- indigenous people, enslaved people, free people of color, and settlers -- experience the change in governance and take advantage of overlaps and tensions between imperial powers? And how did a new colonizing power attempt to govern a ""foreign"" people who had established roots and transformed the landscape, economy, customs, and Native American diplomatic relations?

Trenton’s “riots” became a simplified explanation for the city’s woes. Yet there has been little research into the nation’s “scenes of racial violence,” as named by the Philadelphia Inquirer. Uprisings centers on Harlan Bruce Joseph, a black college sophomore at Lincoln University who was fatally shot by a white officer during minor unrest in Trenton. Joseph’s life reveals a committed young man interested in the ministry who worked to make a better Trenton. The circumstances of his death correct longstanding misperceptions of the “riots” and their meaning. The shooting entwined a young man and his city in tragedy.

This will significantly expand content, and accordingly, audience, providing easily navigable, fully translated English content for educators addressing world religions, global art history, biographic literature, textual studies and South Asia-focused courses, among others."

At the time of her death in 1925, Lowell was one of the most celebrated and sought-after authors in America, respected both as a poet and as a literary critic. She published prodigiously during her fifteen-year career (1910-1925): six volumes of poetry (three more were published posthumously), two volumes of literary criticism, a two-volume biography of John Keats, and countless articles and reviews. <em>What’s O’Clock,</em> in press at the time of her death, won the 1926 Pulitzer Prize for poetry. She corresponded with virtually all the most prominent poets, editors, and magazine publishers of her time, yet no representative collection of her letters exists I am editing, annotating and doing XML markup on letters related to her career as a powerful, polarizing, and influential figure in twentieth century poetry."

Today, the basilica reconstructed on the site only loosely reflects the original, but it stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Monument. Over the course of 10 years, I have digitally recreated the original basilica during salient moments of its millennial history. That work culminated in a book and website.

Enriching public programming is intended to be multivalent and to build partnerships with other local cultural and academic institutions. The CMA seeks support for exhibition-related activities that require retaining humanities staff to maintain and adapt critical public programs."

Understanding how people used color  in the ancient world can tell us about their beliefs, values, and how they viewed the world around them. Color could be found everywhere: in architectural spaces, on sculpture, and in the clothing people wore. Color choices were made at every level of society, from emperors to individuals in their daily lives. Color was a commodity that traveled across the ancient Mediterranean, from western Spain to the Fayoum region of Egypt. Certain colors were so valued – and so rare – that people devised ways to create them chemically. We know much of this thanks to the scientific study of color that survives on artifacts. Technical color research provides physical evidence of the prevalence and variety of color in antiquity, and is changing the way we think about the ancient world."

Three summer programs will focus on topics that represent under-explored aspects of the region’s cultural heritage: 1) a comparative analysis of Montana’s pandemics in 1918 and 2020; 2) the crucial yet overlooked role of people of color in the region’s formation; and 3) the impact of mining waste on community and ecology. The program will utilize community resources and strengthen humanities pathways."

Rochester, NY has been the site of critical intellectual American ideas, from abolitionism to women’s rights. While home to leaders such as Frederick Douglass and Susan B. Anthony, the city’s significance plays but a small part in scholarly understanding of these iconic figures. The project objectives are as follows: 1) create spaces for critical conversation around race focused on place-based humanistic texts, while promoting interest in the humanities; 2) embed the teaching of place-based humanities in the core curriculum; and 3) disseminate a place-based humanities pedagogy with other faculty at SJFC and beyond."

Finnegan treats the photograph as a locus for viewer engagement and constructs a history of photography's viewers that shows how Americans used words about images to participate in the politics of their day. As she shows, encounters with photography helped viewers negotiate the emergent anxieties and crises of U.S. public life through not only persuasion but action as well. Telling a new story about a medium and an institution that have largely grown up together, this book offers readers an accessible, visually engaging story about photography, the presidency, and public life."

While Vietnam became a crude metaphor for military quagmire that observers readily applied to Soviet involvement in Afghanistan, my project pursues the far deeper cultural connections between the wars. Building on Michael Rothberg's concept of ""multidirectional memory,"" my book will explore the dynamic process by which the wars in Vietnam and Afghanistan, and by extension American and Soviet political identities, were continuously framed in relation to one another. The project's core hypothesis is that the Vietnam-Afghanistan analogy was central to how Americans and Soviet Russians negotiated both the meaning of these two conflicts and their countries’ place in the world. As I contend, these negotiations hastened the USSR’s collapse and fueled the revival of an American exceptionalism that outlived the Cold War itself."

Rooted in settler colonialism and misguided Progressive Era philanthropy, the OIA constructed frame houses around Indigenous peoples in an effort to instill American family structures, land use, and moral authority. The government used architectural determinism (the belief that the physical structure of the house could restructure the behavior of the residents within) to erase tribal cultures.

A founder and chair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Lewis led major campaigns from the Freedom Rides to the March on Washington to the Selma voting rights march. Ousted as SNCC chairman in 1966, Lewis entered politics, joining Robert Kennedy’s 1968 presidential bid, registering Blacks to vote in the 1970s, and in 1986 winning a seat in Congress, where he rose to be a deputy to the Speaker. Legislatively, he helped extend the Voting Rights Act, established a Black history museum in Washington, and served as “the conscience of Congress.” Lewis’s life story thus shows how the energies of the 1960s civil rights movement, in his person, carried on the drive for racial equality in the following decades."

Despite its quantity and diversity, however, Nicholas’s musical hagiography has yet to be examined. This project explores for the first time how the creation of new musical repertoires shaped and responded to the expansion of Nicholas’s cult, ca. 1100-1500. Nicholas presents an exceptional case among medieval saints since hagiographical texts repeatedly draw attention to song and its role in defining and disseminating his cult. I argue that music became a lynchpin in hagiographical and cultural negotiations, powerful enough to intervene in discourses around the saint and rituals of time and place, liturgy and devotion, race, religious identity, language, and nationhood."

Second, the Roman practice of concealing evidence of carving has led to fundamental gaps in our knowledge concerning production. This award will support research at archaeological sites and on related objects.

Stranded in Britain, they appeared as specters to English writers who imagined a social solution for them different from the one they had devised for black Africans—a moral sympathy wedded to a policy of detention and deportation rather than abolition.

And I show that a full reckoning with slavery’s legacies and a truly comprehensive system of reparations are impossible without accounting for lineages and histories that derive from other, less commonly recognized forms of inheritance.

That exclusion from compulsory military service has had far-reaching consequences for women’s legal standing, economic opportunities, and citizenship. Requiring women to register for Selective Service will remove the last major legal distinction between the obligations and benefits of citizenship for men and women. Drafting Women will provide the necessary historical background for an informed public discussion about what that decision means. The question of drafting women is, at its heart, a question about what it means to serve in the military. It is a question about the relationship between military service and full citizenship.

In redefining music as movement, the book argues that sign language music, rather than being marginal or extraneous to histories and theories of music, is in fact central and crucial to our understanding of all musical expression and experience.

Drawing on and complementing current sociological work in network analysis, I claim that recent fiction uses networks in innovative ways in its representations of precarity, exclusion, and individual and collective action.

This monograph argues that prisoners of war acted as crucial conduits in the development of military and commercial intelligence in the long conflict between the growing British colonies of the southeast and Spanish Florida. It uncovers the varied experiences of prisoners of war before the codification of international laws about the taking and holding of captives. People seized by an enemy might be closely confined, subject to interrogation, allowed to wander freely or quickly returned to their countrymen. Colonial officials sometimes kept captives in enemy cities for weeks or months before freeing them to inevitably bring military information to their own lines. Investigating the impact of intelligence-gathering by prisoners reveals networks of information that were inadvertently created by captives and officials on the edges of empire."

Significantly, to this point, the translation of racial labels and the representation of racialized linguistic practice have been parallel but ultimately separate lines of research. A review of academic literature on the topic reveals that no existing study examines both translation phenomena. The present study seeks to fill that gap. In addition to the project’s significance as a scholarly endeavor, it is also a significant inquiry for the current social and political moment. Final products will include research talks, an article manuscript, and a podcast episode."

But today, discussions of sexual violence are dominated by the law and public health. What Does Rape Look Like? seeks to reinvigorate humanistic contributions to the antirape movement. I argue that contemporary American art and literature, especially by women and queer people of color, better understands sexual violence than legal and public health discourses. Whereas the law classifies interpersonal crimes and determines individual responsibility for them, and whereas public health surveils a population to model the incidence, causes, and economic burden of violence, an aesthetic discourse asks how a larger cultural context creates rape, how the genres and forms in which the story of rape is told set the boundaries of its intelligibility, and how metaphorical thinking can transform those boundaries."

On Sunday, July 16, 1854, Jennings stepped onto a ‘whites-only’ streetcar on Third Avenue becoming the first among a small army of young black women and men to fight to forcibly desegregate mass transit in New York City. The First Freedom Riders argues that their campaign to stage a civil war in miniature was unprecedented, radical, and highly coordinated. To disrupt and destroy Jim Crow in Gotham City, black activists built a new organization, the Legal Rights Association, that pioneered the art and science of protesting in public and developed strategies of civil disobedience—public set-pieces, boycotts, petitions, defense funds, etc.—that have become the hallmarks of grassroots anti-racism protests ever since."

The main goal is to explore the characteristics of these collaborations studying the context in which these films emerged, how they were made, their promotion, reception, and circulation within and beyond television. While doing so, it advances an understanding of Latin American cinema as a deeply transnational one, largely produced outside the boundaries of the nation-state.

Likewise, “taste” referred both to bodily sensation and readerly pleasure; the consumption of food as well as a discerning appetite for literary culture. Seasonal Tastes puts literary works and “how to” literature in dialogue to explore flavor, time, literary form, and climate in the early modern period. This project intervenes in debates about how nature is depicted within literary studies, and within the humanities more broadly, by taking seasons as its central focus."

And how can oral history help us understand historic shifts in indigenous food systems, disease, and the environment?

This project explores the latter understudied resettlement period to understand the paradox of “alien belonging”: literally excluded Japanese Americans became the beneficiary of expansive state and private largesse, largesse not without constraints but inaccessible to most citizens. This aid helped Japanese migrants and their U.S.-born children to leave incarceration camps and craft forms of belonging in adopted communities that belied their alien status. Their story demonstrates a resonant alien inclusion, as Americans today struggle to understand our obligations towards detained migrants, asylum-seekers, religious minorities, and others seen as alien and excluded."

A contextualized and in-depth study of each of the available sources, which will be carried out in the proposed book-project, is necessary in order to understand the role that those agents played in the ancient Egyptian religious beliefs and how people would communicate with demons through magical practices and the help of professional ritualists.

Using a history of the book approach, I argue that these books illuminated how women navigated a society in which literal and symbolic violence against women and children was quite ordinary, and state authorities were often indifferent or hostile to the victims.

Few Indigenous have ever been studied extensively in terms of their book history, and through textual and bibliographical analysis along with substantial archival research, I attend to this significant scholarly gap by demonstrating the cultural connection between book history and the histories of displacement and resistance of Indigenous peoples."

The foundational question of this discipline is “How do we know?” That is, what counts as knowledge, and when do we have it? Science is often cited as generating special access to certain kinds of knowledge, but philosophical study of how science contributes to epistemology has primarily analyzed scientific theories, models, and explanations as the houses of knowledge. Philosophers have overlooked how the fruits of scientific making — that is, the synthesis of chemicals, materials, and biological parts — contribute to the structure and character of scientific knowledge. Using case studies from nanoscience, this project will establish an account of how synthesis generates and shapes scientific knowledge. The account will form the concluding chapter of my in-progress debut monograph, which concerns the contributions of nanoscience to philosophy of science."

This seeming contradiction held implications for the expansion and restriction of rights in other colonies and prompted decades of debate. Through laws, court cases, elections, petitions, and protests, we see how Senegalese men and women shaped that debate, mobilizing their own ideas about citizenship to seek political rights, legal protections, religious autonomy, and economic and educational opportunities. I argue that as they made claims on the French state, they also raised questions about the compatibility of French citizenship and Muslim law and called attention to the contradictions underpinning the French imperial project.<br />"

Against centuries of efforts to fix a single authentic Ignatius, I demonstrate that the letters are best interpreted as an “open text,” a corpus constitutively open to rearrangement, excerpting, or expansion.

To compose metered poetry in Arabic, I argue, was not necessarily to be backward-looking or conservative. Meter and rhyme facilitated the oral transmission of poetry when publishing resources were limited, and the ancient meters were often used as forms of anti-colonial protest. When Arab poets discussed topics like “freedom,” “constraint,” “unity,” and “originality” in poetry, they were talking about much more than meters, strophes, and rhymes. The language of poetic form, I argue, was a metonymic one: poetry and its critical paratexts became the spaces where Arab intellectuals worked through questions of Arab identity, national citizenship, technological modernity, religion, secularism, and interactions with the West."

Protestants inspired by the social gospel fought for just immigration reform and established settlement houses to aid and Americanize new immigrants. Other Protestants joined groups to restrict immigration and promote white Protestant supremacy. The challenge of mass immigration was more complicated for Irish Catholic and German Jewish Americans. As established American citizens they revered many of the same cultural values as Protestants, and the habits and beliefs of their co-religionists from eastern and southern Europe threatened to destabilize the acceptance they had gained in a Protestant-dominated society. While most sought just immigration policies, they disagreed on how new immigrants should fit with American society."

Through linguistic consultation with Michif speakers, this project aims to develop a bilingual lexical database and grammatically analyzed corpus of Michif based on a seminal dictionary of the language. The resulting digital resources will result in much improved long-term access to a central resource for studies of Michif, as well as a much clearer view on the outcomes of language contact in a typologically exceptional and critically endangered contact language."

Remarkably, these contributions were entangled with British imperial art, architecture, and gardens, as well as with American collections of European art. As such, the VMH represents the confluence of Indian, British, and American networks of art, architecture, and garden-design. Our project investigates how the VMH’s Indian legacy was shaped by these transnational networks, and how that legacy might be analyzed within the broader context of decolonizing imperial histories. This project involves scholars from the United States, the UK, and India, who will participate, first, in an exploratory workshop at the VMH and, next, in a virtual symposium."

In an extraordinarily diverse career, he wrangled with many of the most critical issues of the last century, from environmental degradation to civil rights.

Well-known scholars argue that the American prison industry developed as a Southern effort to re-install slavery after the Civil War. In contrast, I show how the antebellum North originated for-profit convict labor (a fact that previous scholars acknowledge but have not communicated effectively to the public). This fact matters because the Northern mode of convict labor led to distinctive forms of racism: ones based in liberal reform, modern manufacturing, and even abolitionism. By narrating the life of one Black man, his family, and his city, my book restores the antebellum North to the stories we tell about profit-driven incarceration and racism—thus changing what we know about each."

This is not only a dramatic story  worth telling in its own right but, with hindsight, we can see that it was the first “modern’ Supreme Court confirmation battle, featuring  protracted Senate hearings, a concerted attack on Brandeis’s character and ethics, and a heated public debate about the nominee’s political beliefs and fitness for a Court seat, with much of the opposition, Brandeis believed, due to antisemitism. Nominations to the Supreme Court have recently been, and will surely remain, a  source of partisan controversy.

I demonstrate that aspirations for equality have been more vibrant, more varied in their origins, and more successfully implemented than most readers may imagine.

This book seeks to reinvigorate discussion about what equality has meant – and might yet mean – in the United States."

It introduces readers to a sexual past that is both familiar and strange by illuminating how the meanings people gave to sexual desires and behaviors changed over time. This project emphasizes the desires and experiences of diverse people of color, the history of gender fluidity, and the importance of sexuality to nation building. The book’s capacious scope permits readers to identify connections across topics, such as queer desires, sexual violence, reproductive labor, and erotic enticement. This book provides a history of sex whose importance transcends isolated experiences or identities, one that reveals contexts and conflicts at the heart of the American past."

Since antiquity, lineage has shaped power relations, material inheritance, legal rights, and that amorphous but meaningful thing we call “identity.” Ancestry itself, I argue, has an ancestry. Different ways of recording where we come from are layered onto one another. Genealogies capture the priorities of various kinship systems; laws codify privileges and exclusions based on lineage; and today’s sleek DNA kits deliver a record of ancestry anchored in biology, even as their results are interpreted in ways that rest on deep, if not always acknowledged, assumptions about status, race, ethnicity, and nationhood. Ranging from pre-history to the present, my book will describe how ancestry has operated in specific historical contexts, with the goal of explaining why, for whom, and in what ways lineage has been invested with power."

America’s Contrarian Sage corrects this misperception. In fact, in the final two decades of his life, Richard Nixon invented the modern post-presidency. Having been forced to abandon his presidential designs for what he liked to call a “structure of [world] peace” solid enough to last for generations, Nixon dedicated himself to this unfinished work post-resignation. In the process, he fashioned a new, active public role for ex-presidents, a roadmap adapted with great success by those who followed him. Written not just for scholars, but for a general audience as well, America’s Contrarian Sage moves beyond the entrenched positions of Nixon critics and defenders to be the definitive history of Richard Nixon’s post-presidency."

Despite the intensity and prevalence of this type of relationship, it has no widely agreed-upon name, nor social or legal recognition. Through vivid stories of platonic partnerships past and present, the book will demonstrate that these overlooked relationships can help us fundamentally reframe and expand our concepts of intimacy, partnership, caregiving, and family. This is an especially relevant endeavor at a time when marriage and the nuclear family are losing their force as the organizing frameworks for Americans’ lives. These friendships bring to the surface unquestioned assumptions that most people have—and that are enshrined in the law—about what types of relationships matter most."

Here, I examine the army’s attempts to manage “race” during the late ‘60s and early ‘70s, exploring the struggles that yielded military justice reform, limited acceptance of cultural symbols (Afros; the dap), race relations education, and affirmative action programs. I show that, despite systemic racism, individuals made a difference, and argue that the army’s “institutional logic”-- the collective force of the army’s culture, history, and tradition, its structure and organization, its avowed mission—determined, to a great extent, how those attempted solutions played out: what would most easily succeed; what would more likely fail."

Our project is based off a well-established computational musicology framework, humdrum. Our project modernizes and expands the humdrum ecosystem (consisting of a toolkit and unique data format), introducing a new software package called humdrumR (hum-drummer), and will include online computational musicology tutorials."

In April 2020, a geophysical survey was performed at the Keenan Cemetery to provide the basis of gravesites; locate any unmarked graves; mark those graves; and begin research through archival information for those who were buried in an unmarked grave.  The next step in preserving the Keenan Cemetery is to have a professional assessment of the current gravesites.  This assessment will provide a detailed evaluation and cost of restoration needs for each grave.  By having this evaluation and cost, the Historical Park will be able to create a plan of action and apply for grant funds for the restoration needs, beginning restoration on the gravesites most needed."

Musical performance is an interesting focus of study because, unlike musical scores, a traditional object of study, the performance is what listeners actually hear. A musical performance can convey both the musicians’ interpretation of the written score as well as emphasize, or even manipulate, the emotional content of the music through small variations in timing, dynamics, and tuning. Historically, studies of recorded musical performance have made use of manual techniques, but their laboriousness limited the number of performances that could be studied and the observations that could be made. The automatic tools provided by AMPACT facilitate much larger-scale investigations than are possible with manual annotation methods."

This project shows, instead, how visualizations always carry a set of implicit assumptions-and, at times, explicit arguments-about how knowledge is produced, and who is authorized to produce it. The project moves chronologically, blending humanistic analyses of historical visualization examples, culled from archival research, with interactive digital recreations of those same designs. The project's custom web platform, collaboratively built with a student development team, taken with its technical features and scholarly content, model a new form of digital humanities scholarship to the academy and beyond."

Atlanta has an ideal nexus of historic sites where teachers can explore these struggles, from the legacy of slavery, the tragedy of war and defeat, the promise of emancipation, the betrayal of Reconstruction, the terror of redemption and race riot, the erection of the color line and resistance to segregation, the civil rights movement, desegregation, integration and resegregation, to a multicultural and pluralistic society.

history, stories, beliefs, and traditions are central to the establishment of
African American cultural institutions and practices, and therefore critical to
understanding American society in general. The institution of slavery and the
contributions of the enslaved and their descendants is foundational to the
formation of the U.S. and has long been undertaught and over-simplified in K-12

understanding of (1) how African Americans, free and enslaved, have strived to
realize the nation’s ideal that “all men are created equal” in
possession of liberty and certain rights, and (2) how
the Gullah-Geechee people, who worked over four centuries to preserve their culture,

On the one hand, this antagonism disrupts the status quo in unanticipated ways—a patriarchal society that has come to expect solidarity between women finds it difficult to deal with female competition—and it helps open new domestic and professional pathways for women. On the other hand, in the effort to achieve gender equality, the professional New Woman’s rhetoric recycles distinctly sexist, racist, and classist mid-Victorian conventions, thereby bringing middle-class Englishwomen dialectically into the labor pool of the British empire, even as they resist patriarchal institutions."

These men conducted judicial work while actively politicking outside their chambers—building partisan coalitions, campaigning on behalf of state and federal officials, even running for political office themselves. This project investigates why the Supreme Court’s relationship to politics changed from these early years. It argues that by the end of the century, as partisan politics grew more complex and geographically dispersed, justices were increasingly unable to exert political influence from their positions on the Court. To bolster their power, justices instead began to describe themselves in apolitical ways and to advocate for a stronger judiciary; they no longer sought to influence national politics through partisan activity, but by judicial decision-making itself."

In a word, this book is about land, and how religious reform profoundly shaped land and landscape in Italy. Reform was never solely confined to the rarefied intellectual realms but rather it circulated much more widely and demanded thinking about matters as seemingly mundane as property boundaries and rights to water, orchards, pastures, and mills.

Looking at a wide range of works by canonical nineteenth-century European Decadents and by fin-de-siècle writers from the European periphery and British colonies who were among the first to adapt their work to new local contexts, I argue that Decadent writing provided powerful models for capturing the paradoxes of economic and political development."

I argue that Cuban anti-communism was never restricted to merely opposing Fidel Castro; instead, it was a global political movement with far-reaching consequences. After the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961, Cuban anti-communist militants took their struggle to Latin America and beyond, applying the military and political experience they developed opposing Castro to help defeat revolutionary and national liberation movements from Puerto Rico to Nicaragua to the Congo. This book will consequently reframe standard assumptions of Cuban counter-revolutionary “failure,” showing that militant exiles’ greatest victories occurred elsewhere in the developing and decolonizing world. Recovering this unknown history sheds new light on the Cold War in the global south by exposing widespread Cuban influence on the anti-communist right, not only the left."

THE MELVILLE EFFECT is the first work to explore this phenomenon by evaluating the uses that many of today's  cutting-edge artists are making of Melville's hybrid aesthetics and authorial daring. Examining the effects of such Melville-influenced artistic endeavors sheds light on the status of the arts and humanities in a world in which creative energies are increasingly being reshaped by modes of multimedia, intermedia, and digital technology, as well as evolving conceptions of audience and authorship. The interplay between this iconic figure, his many legacies, and contemporary art also opens the way to a revitalized sense of literary history."

Scholarship has long rested upon the assumption that astrology and prophecy were two very different ways of knowing the future, one based upon natural observations and the other derived from supernatural inspiration. Examination of those who instead blurred the lines between the two, I argue, has much to teach us about the place of the religious and the non-rational in the construction of modern rational and scientific discourse, as well as the myriad and complex ways that people in the past negotiated their way to discovering truth."

Based on ethno-linguistic fieldwork, including data collected from 227 Parisian butchers, this book project chronicles Louchébem by tracing it to its origin, recording its history, and evaluating its current status. This project investigates an endangered cultural and linguistic phenomenon while shedding light on wider issues of modernity, including the role of tradition, the relationship between language and consumption, and the value of linguistic diversity in a world where languages are rapidly dying off."

One of the most central concepts to the theory and analysis of cinema, the frame is fundamental to thinking about the organization of images, the designation of representation, and the positioning of the spectator. Rethinking this concept in relation to VR offers a means to examine how even media that diverge from conventional cinematic framing still accomplish such organization, designation, and positioning. Doing so, moreover, introduces a new set of tools for analyzing and historicizing cinema, suggesting fresh ways to parse the relationships between films’ textual operations, their modes of display, and their social functions. By reassessing framing across cinema and VR, the project ultimately offers a new perspective on the protean material and social parameters of media’s forms."

Stock characters and formulaic hilarity did not prevent these plays from modeling and reproducing the community’s values, promoting working-class unity, and exploring incipient Americanization.

I integrate research from political archives, museums and preservation offices on the Italo-Yugoslav border from 1918 to 1954.

Similarly, my project’s poets were using their pages as epistemological tools—instruments for studying how to represent the work of women’s bodies, as writers, readers, and knowledge practitioners. Reading women’s poetry with anatomical texts reveals a shared set of material-tactile practices that informed early modern poetic and scientific work. My interdisciplinary study challenges readers to rethink what counts as science and brings into focus a feminist poetic history centered on touch."

Lasting economic, social, and cultural ties formed between communities on both sides of the border.  By early 1981, violence from the Guatemalan Civil War (1963-1996) and deepening poverty pushed growing numbers of Guatemalan campesinos to migrate for work on Mexican coffee fincas. Simultaneously, intensifying conflict led thousands of indigenous villagers to abandon their homes and seek safety in Mexico. Some Guatemalans were depicted as unwitting ‘victims’ who deserved asylum and assistance. Others were labeled as “too political” or “opportunistic” and received little support."

I argue that these object transfers serve as the material expression of the widespread (otherwise linguistic) trope of ‘translatio imperii et studii’, the transfer of past imperial authority and cultural prestige to Europe.

This project reclaims stories that shaped the nation on its western fringes through a layered microhistorical approach that captures the textures and tensions associated with land transfers by centering on natural history, Indigenous land claims, the expansion of the nation-state, and homestead histories in four square-mile sections of the Great Plains."

Humanities teach us to examine both how we shape and are shaped by the world around us and nowhere is that more clear than in our connection to the natural world and our impact on the American West landscape. Much of this project, such as our museum exhibits, is developed in partnership with the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation to amplify their voice in the history of our valley and many will be offered in multiple languages to reach underrepresented communities."

My project analyzes how social media has opened up new avenues for civic engagement in Japan. In particular, I examine how a group of “zainichi” Korean activists were able to use social media to mobilize a counter-movement—bringing together a broad coalition of left-wing activists, LGBT minorities, human rights lawyers, and ordinary Japanese citizens—to block hate rallies from entering their community. By challenging prevailing assumptions that social media movements lack organizational cohesion, I stress how space continues to be important in Internet politics by showing how the Korean ghetto became an important site of politicization, turning haphazard supporters into committed activists."

I examine the implications of this unprecedented demographic transition in the context of the Japanese white-collar workplace. I show that firms are hiring and promoting more women and immigrants, but that gender remains a deeper fault line than ethnicity. This stands in contrast to Western nations, where native-born women are advantaged over immigrant men. I argue that because Japan restricts migration for the purposes of low-paid work, Japanese women remain the face of the low-status workforce, reinforcing views of women as less capable and deserving. In contrast, Asian immigrant men are able to disrupt historical prejudices. By demonstrating that the composition of low-level jobs is more important for boundary construction and inequality than that of upper-level jobs, this study overturns assumptions about how status beliefs form in the workplace, and advances understanding of how shrinking populations will reshape inequality."

This project will address this oversight by advancing our understanding of what determines the policies governments use to reduce the vulnerability of their countries to cyber threats by comparing Japan to a country with a very different approach, the United States.

UPM met this demand thanks to investments in technology and a talented staff that quickly transitioned to remote work and a digital workflow. This transition and the new work created by shifts in the market placed unsustainable stress on the staff and systems. To maintain output and create future growth, UPM needs additional staff to transform the emergency response into a long-term digital structure.

We now recognize that while to-date we have included stories and exhibitions that highlight Santa Monica’s Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) and other marginalized groups, our curation and programming has not been holistically inclusive. We now aim to achieve the latter through our new Inclusive History at Santa Monica History Museum project, which will seek, gather, and share the histories of Santa Monica’s BIPOC and other marginalized communities. With generous support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, we will first focus on Santa Monica’s Black/African American community."

With an eye toward sustainability, we will also engage in intense professional development and curricular reform to pivot toward an intercultural approach in language and literature curricula. This approach will highlight the valuable knowledge, skills and attitudes developed by students in the humanities that will serve them in any future path."

The museum has shipwreck artifacts spanning from 1600 through 1860, enabling it to provide hard evidence of all periods of the trade.  Since 1995, the museum has toured two exhibitions on the slave trade nationally but was never able to show the collection onsite due to space restrictions. In 2020, the museum became able to double the size of its public areas. Unfortunately, due to the impact of COVID on revenue, installation resources dried up.

The residue of a century of filmmaking (theatrical and non-theatrical, professional and amateur, documentary and fiction, news and nonsense) now resides in film archives once or twice removed from the industries and communities that produced the content.

Humanists are well-positioned to trace that change and, through scholarship and teaching, make meaning of its power. Comics@SDSU seeks $150,000 for a two-year initiative to 1) develop ten new courses that will deepen and expand our humanistic comics curriculum, 2) use these courses to populate a proposed certificate in Comic Studies, and 3) support workshops that bring scholars to campus to energize comic studies at our Hispanic Serving Institution. The humanistic approach to the study of comics that we will cultivate through workshops, courses and a certificate program will empower thousands of students to visualize and manifest a more just future."

Since only a small portion of the correspondents’ submissions ever appeared in print, and they have only recently been opened to researchers, digitizing this unique set of microfilm will result in an essential resource for humanities scholarship. This is Phase 1 of a two- phase project that will ultimately result in the digitization of 576 reels of microfilm. The goals of the project are threefold: to preserve the content of the collection, which only exists in this one set of master microfilm; to make it freely available online; and to disseminate it to a large audience."

I will use the records of individuals and of peace organizations to analyze their actions and rhetoric and records of civilian and military agencies relating to national defense and foreign policy to evaluate the efficacy of that activism. My research will illustrate the impact of peace activism on U.S. foreign and domestic policy and behavior.

Over four decades, Dakarois developed practices defined not by its colonial designers but by its inhabitants. This book introduces the concept of local transactional culture – norms city dwellers devised to make urban life feasible under colonial rule. The central element of Dakar’s transactional culture was transience, which permeated trade, work, housing, and interaction with the state. This work reveals that economic relationships in Dakar were shaped by people negotiating the city for their own purposes. As the French colonial state strived for control, the local transactional culture adapted. Transient Transactions’ innovative approach to urban African history uses deep analysis of court cases, state reports, and oral histories to offer new theorization of movement and the rich value of justice archives."

As thousands flocked to Asuero for relief, he and his cure became a transnational cultural phenomenon. The populist rulers of Spain, Italy, and Argentina were among Asuero’s admirers, but the medical establishments of those countries reacted harshly, arguing that he was a quack who should be arrested. The resulting book will make important contributions to the medical humanities by documenting how doctors, patients, and politicians were portrayed in transnational popular culture, to the history of the politicization of medicine, and to the history of medical professionalization in Spain and Latin America."

These images reveal how colonial governance sought to respond to newfound conceptions of famine and hunger as a state responsibility even as it encouraged policies that greatly exacerbated the causes and effects of famine. Indeed, photography created, aided, and abetted the circulation of moral sentimentality toward famine victims through the very images intended to visually propagate and institutionalize the Raj’s extractive colonial policies. This study unites, for the first time, visual studies with environmental studies and the economic history of colonial India to shed light on the very paradox of Raj colonial humanitarianism, which sought to stave off famine by reifying many of the very policies that sustained it."

These defamatory, seditious texts are launched into the sky, cast in a window, affixed to a statue, recited in court, read from a pulpit, and seized by informers. I argue that these overlooked representations of libel have much to tell us about England’s nascent public sphere and the place of drama within it. Libels were marked by mobility: they swirled across the early modern media and across class, confessional, and geographical boundaries. From London to Lincolnshire, amateur and professional playmakers alike staged all sorts of seditious scripts. I study the diverse contact zones between libels and plays, tracing the contours of a viral and virulent media ecosystem."

The fact that the Reformation had made the early church rhetorically central to its project—but had manifestly not recovered apostolic religion—made the early church a site of fantasy, projection, and longing for latter-day Protestants coping with the imperfections of their own church. Reading the works of Spenser, Shakespeare, Donne, and Milton alongside sermons, devotional texts, martyrologies, and works of British history, I show the many ways that early modern English culture fostered a sense of identification with the earliest Christians. Nevertheless, Protestants were not contemplating a stable object when they looked at the early church. I argue that as Protestants grappled with the unfinished business of the Reformation, the early church could represent both a lost, idealized past and a lost future. It was therefore a tool for thinking about the Reformation itself."

These colonial revival designs invited viewers to learn American history through aesthetic experience, not through reading or writing but through seemingly direct contact with the look and feel of history itself. This experience of feeling history produced uncanny effects, in which viewers underwent strange disconnects of time and space, and it helped naturalize ideologies of American exceptionalism and white nationalism. Yet relatively marginalized Americans, including women, recent immigrants, queer people, and people of color, took park in constructing these designs. By interrogating colonial revivalism, this book analyzes how an aesthetic experience of the past became effective at empowering new groups of Americans to take part in the design of American identity."

Therefore, a central tenet of the minor will be a humanities-based exploration of rurality—what it means to live close to the land in rural communities and on working farms. Rooted will be relevant to the realities of the lives of rural students, and will use a place-based pedagogical framework that recognizes that students learn best when the knowledge they acquire in their courses is directly connected to the way of life, background, and culture that roots them to their physical homes."

The monks of La Trinité employed the tradition of crusader narratives in developing a context that justified their possession of the relic. This case study addresses the central question of how devotional practices were established around a relic that had no significant pre-existing cult. This project is of value to the humanities because it advances our understanding of the enshrinement and display of Christ relics and the development of crusader and Holy Land relic narratives, two issues of significance in medieval studies. A digital teaching companion will complement the book."

Drawing inspiration from African history and global media, his work presents portraits of Civil Rights and First Nation leaders alongside news imagery from South Africa in flatbed compositions marked by grids and vibrant Pop coloration. I examine the eclectic art historical lineage and legacy of his work, which is reflective of the fragmentary nature of exile and may serve as a bridge connecting art historical genres often seen as discursively separate.

Its innovation typified the experimentation that occurred at Charles III’s Aranjuez Palace. Serving as the king’s office where he negotiated policy, the room embodied political messages that formed his imperial agenda and sense of kingship. I frame the room’s implementation of the rococo and chinoiserie as more than whimsical design. Rather, I assert that they are critical modes used to express Charles’ taste and imperial desires. Aranjuez embodied a microcosm of empire in its plantings, wildlife, and in the office’s ornately designed botanical, aviary, and bestiary motifs. By relating the botanical and zoological operations conducted at Aranjuez  to the diversity and abundance of natural motifs in the Porcelain Room, both the room and the palace grounds show analogous ways to display the wealth of empire. I situate this interior in the context of eighteenth-century geopolitics."

I will record conversations in Meskwaki between fluent first language speakers to capture naturalistic, linguistically-rich interactions. I will select a sample of the conversations and publish them in a book which will include an audio accompaniment."

Historians have long regarded artisans as key to working-class political consciousness and organization, a line of analysis which has too often excluded or neglected Black practitioners of these trades. My work challenges this oversight, arguing that the radical potentialities of skilled manual labor transcend racial boundaries, particularly in the era of slavery and emancipation.

In arguing for voice-based composition, I propose a new ontology for popular song that centers the human element, conceiving of a song not as an abstract collection of notes, chords, and words but as the direct statement of a singing persona, one whose voice communicates not only a lyrical message but also corporeality, emotional states, and social identity. Treating sound and voice not as so-called “secondary parameters” but as primary aspects of a popular song expands what counts as musical structure and recasts traditional notions of what gives music its value, which may help finally put to rest the tired notion that popular music is musically simplistic."

My book project, “Anti-Red: Global Anticommunism and Transpacific Mobilities,” argues that understanding today’s contemporary migration regime requires a deeper engagement with the way the Cold War shaped mobility and refugee policy during the violent upheavals of postwar decolonization, especially in the Asia Pacific. Assembling a body of transnational Asian fiction and film from the 1950s to the present—including works by refugees, exiles, former soldiers and detainees—I show how these narratives map the way the Cold War rerouted the struggles of decolonization into regimes of selective mobility."

It also reveals the continuities between Aristotle and the later classical tradition’s understanding of friendship by contributing to the long-standing debate about the Aristotelian influence on the Stoic doctrine of <em>oikeiôsis</em> (appropriation), the developmental process whereby basic instinctual drives mature into higher order, moral and rational states, including a disposition to value the well-being of others as integral to our own. Aristotle’s account of our identification with the good of others is important not only for our understanding of these continuities, but because it offers a compelling case for how we might think of ourselves as naturally fitted for community."

Indigenous people negotiated the symbolic forms of dying within the mobile spatial configurations of the colonial cities.

This book breaks new ground. Whereas most studies on Jews and colonialism use the lens of intellectual and legal history, mine is a social history.

It is the specific tension between the allure of sensory experience and the Buddhist distrust of the senses, I propose, that animates the text’s proliferation of looping plots, displaced desire, and obsessive repetition. Sensory experience, then, emerges against the vanishing point of Buddhist disavowal and through the reflective power of the mind. <em>The Tale of Genji </em>activates sensation even as it attempts to overcome it."

Their work in the cultural realm (changing how people think and act) has had a formative impact on politics. Drawing on years of multi-sited fieldwork in Turkey, this book explores how movements leverage cultural production to create sociopolitical change. To do so, it moves from a narrow conception of struggles over power as a coercive force to a broader conception of power as the creation of categories to impose particular notions of reality, demarcate normalcy, and marginalize alternatives. The book uses this framework to explain Islamist mobilization in Turkey and the complex relationship between culture and politics in shaping social reality."

I argue that, during the repeated upheavals that threatened lives, livelihoods, and sovereignties, cross-cultural law and justice served as a tool that many Seminoles, Lower Creeks, Mikasukis, Spaniards, and African Americans–and a few Anglo-Americans–used to control local violence, bolster their alliances, and block U.S. expansion into East Florida. My research completes this larger work, the first book to examine the cross-cultural legal history of the late colonial Florida borderlands and illuminate the plural dimensions of law in the making of the American South and in our nation’s founding and development."

The monumental building projects and visual works that followed devastating storms in Havana (1926), San Juan (1928), and Santo Domingo (1930) demonstrated how Caribbean modernity has constructed “natural disasters”-- particularly hurricanes and their aftermath.

State officials, I show, leveraged imprisoned people’s newly expanded constitutional rights—and the bureaucratic structures implemented in response to them—to thwart prisoners’ ability to organize. They then redirected those structures to shore up their power and serve as barriers between prisoners and the courts. By illuminating how imprisoned people’s legal victories undermined their broader goals, this project reframes our understanding of the origins of today’s prison practices, connects the prisoners’ rights and labor movements, and offers new insight into the decline of liberalism after the 1960s."

Through close analyses of her films—<em>A New Leaf</em> (1971), <em>The Heartbreak Kid</em> (1972), <em>Mikey and Nicky</em> (1976), and <em>Ishtar</em> (1987)—I suggest that May’s unorthodox approach to characterization, narration, and genre is at once a defining feature of her cinema, and one that has been overshadowed by a critical emphasis on her persona.

Firstly, we, as humanities scholars, must fundamentally reconceptualize our understanding of nineteenth-century gender to account for the possibility of movement between, across, and among genders. Secondly, we must use this understanding to consider the possibilities of trans narratives within the diversity of gender identities represented throughout Victorian literary culture. In making room for transgender studies’ understanding of gender and sex as multiple, changeable, and constructed, the book’s trans-inclusive vision of Victorian gender identities demonstrates how the categories of woman and man were being constructed and revised throughout the century. Furthermore, it foregrounds how the oppositional, binary discourse of gender necessarily reveals its own contradictions in the form of bodies and genders that refuse to fit into one of only two gender identities."

The book explores how liberal economic thinkers such as Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Alfred Marshall, and others were translated into Indian languages, particularly Urdu. Drawing on a previously unexplored archive of these translations, the book argues that the translation of liberal political economy into Urdu came to be mediated by early modern Indo-Persian intellectual traditions. In particular, Indian translators made sense of liberal economic thought by relating it to Indo-Persian conceptions of ethics, politics, household management, and alchemy. The book, thus, shows that liberal economic ideas found a new life in India by intermingling with early modern languages of wealth and statecraft."

Finally, what do the countless versions of Jesus tell us about the people and cultures who produced them in literature, art, music, and films, up to the present? While all scholars start from New Testament texts, here I investigate a far wider range of sources, including many nearly always left out of such discussions: Gospels later denounced as “heresy;” and anti-Christian writings by critics of the early movement. Like <em>The Gnostic Gospels</em> and others I have written, this book is addressed not only to scholars and students, but also to a much wider audience, offering a historical view of how Christianity began, and how it resonates today."

Results of excavations begun in 2017 will be integrated with new research identifying and exploring the experiences of an ever-changing staff of seasonal employees. Applying advances in borderland theory with an emphasis on Black agency, the team will examine how the hotel’s employees collaborated with African-descended people on both sides of the US-Canadian boundary to ensure safe passage for uncounted numbers of freedom seekers. Products will include an accessibly written, richly illustrated volume, complemented by a web-based StoryMap, QR-coded interpretive materials linked to the Cataract’s location, and a social media campaign inviting descendant participation."

Composed circa 1180 CE, the epic poem guides readers through the sufferings that God subjects upon spiritual pilgrims.

It features Indian people who defy these myths, people who sought a viable way forward under difficult circumstances, and who did so with a strong sense of their Native heritage. They include Pretty Shield, who worked alongside white and Black women in the women’s club movement, and buffalo hunter Medicine Crow, who became one of many successful wheat farmers.

Their stories are compelling, heartbreaking, and unforgettable.  Understanding the long, slow, and incomplete process by which ex-slaves reclaimed and rebuilt their families forces us to rethink the narrative of American freedom. Reconstruction marked the beginning of a new chapter in American history in which the nation sought a way forward, without slavery. It has often been portrayed as a moment of reunion, both for the nation and for ex-slaves who are pictured happily embracing one another again and moving on, together, into freedom. Instead it was the beginning of a long process of holding on to hope and managing expectations. How did ex-slaves make freedom even as missing family tugged them back to slavery?"

""This Is Rhythm"" traces Jenkins’ life from her South Side childhood to her receipt of a lifetime Grammy Award (2004), positioning her not only as a recording artist and performer, but as a grassroots African American female educator who advanced civil rights through rhythm and song."

Although segregationist politicians claimed to support the strict separation of the races, the continued existence of mixed-race families in Mississippi into the twentieth century reveals the contradictions and complexity of how segregation law was understood and enforced at the local level. Ultimately, white supremacists sought to erase the existence of such familial ties across the color line to perpetuate the myth of segregationists’ historic commitment to “racial purity.”"

Lawrence’s travels to Nigeria in 1962 and 1964 occurred just a few years after Nigerian independence, when the citizens were embracing self-governance and developing the strategies to present a modern Nigeria to the world. The arts—music, literature, and drama—contributed forcefully to this sense of self-determination. The exhibition also explores his relationship with the Mbari Artists and Writers Club, an organization of continental African-based artists, writers, and dramatists promoting modern African artistic practice, and the Club's arts journal publication Black Orpheus."

Viewers particularly noted the veracity of Constable’s clouds. Indeed, our computational research shows that Constable’s clouds are more closely modeled on the structure of actual clouds than those of his contemporaries, with French academician Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes a near rival. Valenciennes taught a generation of landscape artists, emphasizing the importance of plein-air sky studies, yet histories of French landscape tend to cast Constable as Realism’s catalyst. After Constable’s Clouds will test this historiography by using computer vision to classify and compare the clouds in paintings by Barbizon, Realist, and Impressionist painters with those of Constable and Valenciennes."

Rarely if ever credited, dance-ins illuminate the acts of reproduction that lay concealed behind filmic images of seemingly autonomous dancing bodies. The book examines these acts of reproduction, focusing on the relationship between a handful of Hollywood stars and dance-ins from the 1940s to the 1960s, during the “Golden Age” of Hollywood musicals. While stars in this era were predominantly white and choreographers predominantly male, attention to dance-ins reveals a more complicated raced and gendered ecosystem of bodies in Hollywood.

Celebrated in Castilian and Latin sources as Rey Lobo/Rex Lupus and denigrated in Arabic sources as irreligious and disloyal to fellow Muslims, Ibn Mardanish's kingdom at its peak constituted nearly half of al-Andalus and served as an important buffer between the Almohads and the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon. Through a close examination of contemporary sources (chronicles, chancery documents, poetry, architecture, coinage, and artifacts) Abigail Krasner Balbale shows that Ibn Mardanish's dynasty was actually an attempt to integrate al-Andalus more closely with the Islamic East, particularly the Abbasid caliphate. At stake in his battles against the Almohads was the very idea of the caliphate in this period, as well as who could define righteous religious authority."

The penny press shared elite concerns about the destructive vices of working-class men, and urged them to be devoted husbands, responsible citizens, and diligent workers; but it also used biting satire to recast negative portrayals of working-class masculinity and to overturn established social hierarchies. In this challenge to the ""macho"" stereotype of working-class Mexican men, Buffington shows how the penny press contributed to the formation of working-class consciousness."

Christopher R. Boyer examines this history in Political Landscapes, where he argues that the forests in Chihuahua and Michoacán became what he calls ""political landscapes""—that is, geographies that become politicized by the interactions between opposing actors—through the effects of backroom deals, nepotism, and political negotiations. Understanding the historical dynamic of community forestry in Mexico is particularly critical for those interested in promoting community involvement in the use and conservation of forestlands around the world."

By examining the history of Highlander, I will contribute to the scholarship on civil rights struggles and on the role of education within social movements."

By first attracting only to then refuse men, it was argued, women ensured the survival of the species by heightening male desire, thus fulfilling nature’s hidden agenda. This reimagining of female modesty as an instinctual response is documented in medical treatises, socio-political essays on human development over deep time, travel narratives, paintings, and the era’s most popular novels.

This made them a key site for creating and enforcing law among polities.  Prize courts created trans- and inter-imperial legal orders as a routine part of their work.  Empires used prize jurisdiction to extend their authority into regions in which imperial institutions were weak.  Prize became a powerful but flawed mode of inter-imperial governance, central to efforts to end the Atlantic slave trade, shape European colonization in Asia, and decide the outcome of the Americas’ independence struggles.

The project draws on 978 flu survivors’ testimonies, gathered from 10 European countries, to compare Europeans’ notions of what caused the pandemic, their impressions of healthcare during the crisis, and their perceptions of the flu as a local, national, and global event. I argue that unlike WWI and COVID-19, the 1918 flu did not serve as a mirror for Europeans’ collective aspirations and failures, so they did not remember it as a collective event, despite its extensive and collective effects on society. This thesis explains why the pandemic is undertheorized in the academic record and overlooked in the public memory but is essential for contextualizing COVID-19."

Their limitation of public expression in order to reduce sectarian conflict helps reveal stark choices that still confront the question of peace or war today."

Many contemporary historians share this approach, differentiating primitive and hostile dancers from forward-thinking, accommodating ones. In contrast, my book centers Native people by way of four departures from earlier work. I expand the cast of Native actors, push the historical timeline backward and forward, rely primarily on Native sources, and structure the narrative around key themes in Indigenous Studies, including kinship, land, and sovereignty. In sum, I portray a pan-Indian ritual movement to save a beloved and threatened world, an effort that resonates with contemporary Native activism to improve tribal life, defend sovereignty, and protest environmental degradation."

Junk, at its most interesting, is the mass-produced object become individualized or localized.

At its core, Reimagining Colonialism inverts traditional scholarship that centers on how Andean communities repositioned themselves as part of the Inka and Spanish Empires, and instead shows how this community saw the Inka and the Spanish as parts of their local history."

As a result of this multifaceted process, European colonizers invented, as much as they enacted, colonial settlement and rule.  Built on fifteen years of archival research in seven countries, this book seeks to contrast colonialist mythistory with an evidence-based, comparative analysis of African, Maya, Miskitu, and European experiences.

But this linguistic model of mind faces a significant problem. It struggles to accommodate nonhuman animals, which are too sophisticated to be explained without thoughts yet not sophisticated enough to be explained with sentence-like thoughts. Drawing on research from the cognitive sciences, my project develops a detailed, philosophical account of the nonlinguistic mind that explains animal intelligence and reorients our understanding of human uniqueness."

A hemispheric approach to modernist studies highlights a distinctive set of formal and thematic elements. These texts emphasize radical (leftist) political ideologies, celebrate indigeneity and the “folk,” employ a mode of “romantic realism,” rely on simple, lyrical poetic expressions, and are oriented toward a wide and diverse general public instead of a coterie of learned sophisticates.

Under this system, French merchants purchased captives from African traders, then offered the captives their freedom. In exchange, the captives had to repay the price of their so-called redemption from slavery by working on French plantations as indentured laborers for 14 years. This manuscript traces the evolution of this practice from its inception to its 1861 abolition in French Atlantic and Indian Ocean colonies. An examination of French and <em>engagés’</em> perspectives reveals a developing discourse about the boundaries between slavery and free labor in the nineteenth century. French officials insisted that engagement liberated <em>engagés</em> from African slavery. In contrast, <em>engagés</em> argued that they had been traded as captives and were enslaved to the French. Overall, a study of engagement offers an opportunity to study definitions of slavery in the era of abolition."

In doing so, the book underscores the hidden, yet consequential ways in which gaining access to electricity has not only shaped the lives of the urban poor, but also the overall evolution of the electrical grid. In linking these two histories normally cast as separate, the book develops a novel perspective on the urban poor and the environments within which they live.

From the 1870s to the 1920s, the United States underwent great geospatial change: the borders of a post-Civil War West grew to encompass the archipelagoes of the Philippines, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Yet U.S. sovereignty in these territories was never automatic; it was challenged continuously by heterogeneous and mobile populations. White settler struggles for control in the West transformed into new colonial contests over immigration, borders, and territorial control in the islands, with Congress and the Supreme Court constantly in tow. Destabilizing the seeming naturalness of borders, my book examines how turn-of-the-century Americans systematically produced new ideas about the nation’s supposedly inherent power to regulate immigration, and spotlights the volatile landscape in which ideas about the nation’s right to exclude took root."

Born after the 1970s’ collapse of a male-breadwinner norm, the “working family” is the product of immense cultural effort. In the 1980s and 1990s, academics, politicians, journalists, and activists constructed two versions of the model working family. Whereas mainstream conservatives argued that mothers had to “choose” how to manage work and family, liberals called for employers and society to collectively meet working parents’ needs. In both versions, the norm excluded some families—most significantly poor, single Black mothers. The working-family ideal also faced opposition as both hardcore conservatives and feminists led efforts to unseat it. This study traces the working-family norm’s rise to hegemony in law and culture, showing how it structured debates about a post-Fordist workforce, family leave, welfare reform, and mothers’ “choices” about work and family."

Meanwhile, Hastings and his opponents mobilized a vast body of documents translated from Indian languages, justifying their claims in relation to norms of legality derived from the history of the Mughal empire. By examining these efforts to translate Islamicate, Persianate ideas of sovereignty and justice into British political discourse, I will treat the Hastings impeachment as an event in global intellectual history that illuminates broader transitions from early modern to modern forms of law and empire."

I argue that in using exile as a criminal punishment, authorities created new categories of poverty and criminality: exiles became criminal vagrants in the next kingdom, vagrants were easily construed as the notorious bandits of the period. Exiles, vagrants, and bandits were all united by poverty and class: the application of exile was a regressive punishment, primarily used against the lower classes, and one that was experienced wildly differently by those with means versus those without. In this way, I also argue for a reconsideration of the ways in which we think about the creation of poverty in the early modern world, and particularly through the application of labels by the justice system. Though my project focuses on early modern Spain, my project should also speak to scholars working on banditry and crime in other areas like Italy, Germany, and China."

Yet in this book project I show how experiments that took place on television changed the way operas were composed, performed, and experienced.

Far from an excrescence, a “pestilential breath” on the body of the law, as Jeremy Bentham claimed, legal fictions had the power not only to obstruct but to use language to transform the world—a power shared and wielded brilliantly by Victorian novelists.  In an age of constant and world-changing legal reform, the best place to understand the romance as well as the terror of law, the ability to make and remake the world, is in the Victorian novel.   For those who had no legal existence, women, Jews and bastards among them, there was no more potent weapon than the law and its fictions – and it was an instrument of redemption as well as discipline, one that holds possibilities for us today."

During much of this period the Red Army suffered heavy losses, but did not collapse.  Letters of soldiers, diaries, POW interrogations, disciplinary reports and other sources reveal how family connections, memories of home, bonding with comrades-in-arms and experiences of natural beauty all helped soldiers to endure battle and defeat.  They also show that soldiers’ feelings and their stories about war were not determined by Stalinist prescriptions, but emerged from the interaction of those prescriptions with lived experience.  These conclusions serve as the basis for a challenge to claims that culture entirely determines emotions.  They lead further into a discussion of the ways humans make meaning and endure hardship across cultures."

From the WW2-era, it has been the forum for a national, intergenerational discussion, shaped by conceptions of the role of literature in a democracy, about a shared set of texts; an overarching theme has been “The American Way of Life” –  individualism, freedom, equality, the American Dream. The analysis of sources such as lesson plans, classroom editions, and student writing reveals how books such as Julius Caesar, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and The Great Gatsby have been part of the preparation for American citizenship, even as, along with teachers’ approaches and students’ frames of reference, their meaning has changed for different generations. Americans today are still participating in, as well as challenging, this cultural tradition. Exploring U.S. history through the prism of the canon, this book will address academic specialists, educators and general-interest readers."

The study began with an investigation into two unique and interconnected lynching cases within my own family network. Previous scholarship has not sufficiently explored the community ties and intimate relationships between victims and perpetrators, much less the multi-generational effects of racist violence and the lies told about it.

The proposed website responds to this problem by assessing current digitization strategies. Including six thematic essays on the problems of representation, a discovery platform that invites users to interact with different kinds of images, and a set of resources for collection managers, researchers, and teachers, the website invites a more thoughtful and standardized approach to the digitization and study of cylinder seals."

But there are also stories of those who resisted against their colonial overlords or managed to escape their wretched working conditions. This is a new military history, in terms of who the subject is, how the histories are narrated and the kinds of evidence used to reconstruct these histories. It uses the methodological tools of the new history of empire in order to dismantle, from the ground up, the very notion of nation as ethnic unity, war as a well-oiled machine, and the male soldier as a deterministic kind of human being."

With many world languages at risk of extinction, online dictionaries & glossaries are increasingly crucial. Unfortunately, the languages most in need of such resources have the biggest challenges. The availability of digital infrastructure for a language is proportional to its representation - the more data that is available in digital format, the easier it becomes to automatically process it. Conversely, the less a language/culture is represented online, the higher the costs of retrieving and processing data about it. We propose to prototype a digital infrastructure that can help redress this inequality by drastically reducing the costs/technical expertise required to create, publish and maintain online dictionaries. A series of iterative development cycles will bring together user-testers, identify their needs, and prepare an alpha-prototype application to address these needs."

In so doing, the author develops a new model for formal literary analysis that considers the complex histories and mechanisms of comparative racialization."

Temple focuses on William Blackstone's influential work, Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765-1769), which transformed English legal culture and became an international monument to English legal values. Blackstone believed that readers should feel, as much as reason, their way to justice, and as a poet as well as a jurist, was ideally suited to condense English law into a form that evoked emotions.    In Loving Justice, Kathryn D. Temple reimagines the aesthetic and emotional world of 18th century English law and provides the first sustained close reading of Commentaries as a work of high art and sensibility. Employing a unique blend of legal, literary, and political history and theory, the author argues that Commentaries offers a complex map of our relationship to juridical culture and continues to inform our understanding of the concepts of justice and injustice today."

Derek Vaillant provocatively examines this sonic alliance in an era of increased global media production and distribution. Focusing on the period from 1931 until France dismantled its state media system in 1974, Vaillant considers how different strategic agendas, aesthetic aims, and technical systems shaped U.S.-French broadcasting and its accompanying cultural politics. He examines mobile actors, circulating programs, and shifting institutions that shaped international radio's use in times of war and peace. Documenting the achievements, miscommunications and failures, and the limits of cooperation between America and France as they shaped a new media environment,  Vaillant shows how radio's power as an instantaneous mass communications tool produced, legitimized, and circulated various notions of states, cultures, ideologies, and peoples as superior or inferior."

She argues that Peyton Place, with its frank discussions of poverty, sexuality, class and ethnic discrimination, and small-town hypocrisy, was more than a tawdry potboiler: It was part of a larger postwar struggle over belonging and recognition, surfacing the hidden conversations and secret rebellions of a generation no longer willing to ignore the disparities and constraints of Cold War America."

By uncovering the origins of higher education in Tsarist Russia, this book details how the arrival of European pedagogy worked to eventually bring Russia into the modern intellectual mainstream."

By linking the study of the Roman past to French triumphant narratives of the conquest and occupation of the Maghreb, Effros demonstrates how Roman archaeology in the forty years following the conquest of the Ottoman Regencies of Algiers and Constantine in the 1830s helped lay the groundwork for the creation of a new identity for French military and civilian settlers. Effros uses France’s violent colonial war, its efforts to document the ancient Roman past, and its brutal treatment of the region’s Arab and Berber inhabitants to underline the close entanglement of knowledge production, the professionalization of archaeology, and European imperialism."

As she demonstrates, communities that venerated saints increasingly clashed with popes and inquisitors determined to erode any local claims of religious authority. The case studies she presents detail how the political climate of the Italian peninsula allowed Italian communities to use saints' cults as a tool to negotiate religious and political autonomy in opposition to growing papal bureaucratization."

The first book in any language on the hajj under tsarist and Soviet rule, Russian Hajj tells the story of how tsarist officials struggled to control and co-opt Russia's mass hajj traffic, seeing it as not only a liability but also an opportunity. To support the hajj as a matter of state surveillance and control was controversial, given the preeminent position of the Orthodox Church. But nor could the hajj be ignored, or banned, due to Russia's policy of toleration of Islam. As a cross-border, migratory phenomenon, the hajj stoked officials' fears of infectious disease, Islamic revolt, and interethnic conflict, but Eileen Kane innovatively argues that it also generated new thinking within the government about the utility of the empire's Muslims and their global networks."

Placing religious texts and practices within the larger narrative of crusading, Gaposchkin reveals an aspect of crusading that is too easily forgotten—the practice of prayer and its dynamic relationship with the practice of arms—and urges us to remember that medieval Latin Christians were as serious about their faith as they were about their warfare."

From the early modern period to this day, the demand for this delicacy by elite Chinese consumers spurred a trade network that bridged the China Sea and brought transformations to the life and the environment of humans and swiftlets. By examining the knowledge-making, circulation, and consumption of edible birds’ nests, this project engages with transnational dynamics of value creation and accumulation as well as long-term interactions between human institutions and the environment.

I offer a sociological perspective that views hope as both an ideological lure used by the dominant groups to recruit and manage these Italian newcomers and a cultural capital resource immigrants employed to purchase an acceptance and avoid a disparaging label as a “hopelessly alien” stranger. I examine these dialectical responses to hope in terms of the American ethos of occupational mobility, homeownership, and success in the lives of children. Each became forms of cultural capital demonstrating a public commitment to the American spirit of “joyful striving.”  However, I address whether these pursuits of privatized hopes came at the expense of the communal hopes that characterized Italian communities."

Using social biography methods, I weave together evidence from courtroom testimonies, fiction, and genealogical sources with the larger historical contexts in which they were embedded, to piece together a narrative of individual experiences. While commemorating the lives ruined by state-enforced homophobia, I argue that the persecution of same-sex desiring men was central to Irish postcolonial state-building.

I show how Mexican Americans leveraged geopolitics to pressure federal officials into addressing domestic race issues; I also show that a rare moment of political empowerment was not sufficient for advancing civil rights. Federal officials chose expediency—winning the war, advancing foreign policy—over meeting citizens’ needs. Only after publicized episodes of discrimination threatened geopolitics did federal officials deal with domestic race issues.

I explore how and under what circumstances such relationships materialized.

This expansive movement engaged in struggles with prison administrators, staff, and political actors. Yet, as their influence grew, so did the opposition they faced. By the end of the decade, a series of defeats at negotiation tables and in the courts withered prisoners’ ability to assemble against poor conditions and treatment. This set the stage for numerous punitive policy developments to come, including the rise of mass incarceration and the expansion of prison labor systems. Drawing on unique historical data from key prisoner organizations in this era, this project investigates the understudied yet instrumental history of this movement to reframe the nation’s captive workforce as not only protected workers but, indeed, as people in the eyes of prison officials, the courts, and the public."

In the pages of western print culture, westerners encountered the railroad baron, the dude ranch dude, and the effete intellectual long before they stepped east of the Mississippi River.

Over the course of the book, I reveal that awkwardness is a significant aesthetic and critical category in Anglophone theoretical and imaginative texts from at least the mid-eighteenth century onward. The book tells two related stories. The first uncovers an intellectual history with theoretical import. “Awkwardness” is an operative concept in aesthetics and social theory with a rich history. My genealogy of thinkers from Adam Smith until today reveals the specific and critical power of the term as an exceptionally precise measure of artistic or social subversion. The second story shows the heuristic power of awkwardness in Anglophone literature through four case studies on William Wordsworth, John Keats, Emily Dickinson, and Elizabeth Bishop, respectively. &nbsp;"

Never translated into English, the work is fundamental for understanding the development of modern Italian verse. Pascoli derived the title from Vergil’s Fourth Eclogue (“not everyone cares for shrubs and humble tamarisk,” line 2), which he understood as rejecting “simple poetry” for an elevated style. Pascoli counters this rhetoric by employing simple poetic forms to express complex content. The collection draws on everyday objects (e.g., a plow, a broom, a pickax), the landscape, the Anthropocene, the natural world (species of flora and fauna never mentioned in Italian literature find their first appearances here), the disenfranchised to explore themes of change, loss, and wonder. Today, Pascoli’s poetry has emerged as a significant ecocritical voice in the environmental humanities."

Gothic iconography, especially the haunted house, carries a different symbolic weight in black imaginaries. The theorist Paul Gilroy uses the image of “ships in motion across the spaces between Europe, America, Africa, and the Caribbean” as an organizing symbol for the black Atlantic. For my book, it is the haunted house that serves as a central motif in this cultural and geographic setting. I argue that this symbol can also be traced and traversed across time, space, genre, and medium, from slave narratives and early travel writing to contemporary literature, cinema, and popular culture. There are no monographs that illuminate this pattern of haunted houses in the black Atlantic. This book makes that contribution."

By performing the act of listening to women, <em>Le Mercure Galant </em>situates itself as an intermediary, using the nouvelle (short story) as a vehicle to amplify women’s voices.

They dared to prosper, suffered for their ambition, and were forced into exile. Seven months after the massacre, they testified against their assailants in open court. Their testimony convinced the judge to deny the defendants bail. In this far corner of the Jim Crow South, it appeared, for a moment at least, that men who killed in the name of white supremacy might be held to account. Until they weren’t. Although the criminal courts ultimately failed to heed their demand for justice, the resilience and resolve of the Black people of Sandy Beuah teach us that it is never too late to confront and atone for the crimes of our collective past."

I explore what makes it good to be well-rounded, and I show that taking well-roundedness seriously has profound consequences for other areas of normative inquiry. Understanding the full value of well-rounded lives changes how we theorize about well-being more generally, how we evaluate success and failure, and how we consider which goods a just society should distribute fairly.

For if these shooters aspired toward world-breaking violence, they did so knowing others were preparing the Eden that would supposedly sprout up from the remains. For decades, white supremacists have kept busy claiming bioregions, going vegan, recruiting men on hikes, and laboring in other ways to graft whiteness onto planetary futures. These quotidian efforts are not at odds with ecofascist terror. They are precisely where that terror is being cultivated. It is therefore urgent to understand the concept-world that gives them traction: one that links elimination to repair, rendering violence legible as environmental care, and where mass shootings can be pitched as preemptive strikes against the ravages of climate change."

In response, politically conservative and radical Yiddish newspapers alike reshaped their ideological agendas and forged alliances across political and linguistic boundaries. Together, they crafted narratives that privileged the seamless convergence between Jewish culture and American patriotism. Historically, scholars have emphasized the comparative freedom of expression afforded to Jews in the US.

This is the first monograph to use it as a window onto Fascist Italy. Citizenship’s two dimensions – marker of national belonging and warrant of rights – offer an ideal perspective from which to explore Fascism’s central projects: asserting and expanding power in relation to other peoples and territory, and redefining the relationship between regime and citizen. I show that, surprisingly, the Fascists left preexisting citizenship legislation unchanged, actually extended citizenship to imperial subjects, and retained it for Italian Jews even after 1938. For all the regime’s attack on established liberal norms, I argue that it was deeply affected by new international understandings of sovereignty and self-determination. Finally, all too relevant for today, I show how an authoritarian regime could supplant democracy and yet draw considerable internal and international support."

I argue that this patron scene at Basgo, and others at western Himalayan sites, provide critical information about Ladakhi Buddhist court culture especially related to expressions of social stratigraphy, standing of elite women, and the cultural exchange between Ladakh and the Mughal Empire. Analysis of three foci and their associated issues contribute to developing a transregional discussion about medieval patron scenes within Buddhist contexts, and beyond."

A team of Humanities professors currently offering on-line courses in English and in conjunction with the Distance Education department will draw on the best practices criteria of Quality Matters and the evaluation rubric to begin a unified approach to course revision. The aim of this project is to ensure the quality of distance education and as a result increase student motivation, achievement and retention in the Humanities."

Smith explores the interconnected rhetoricity of gender, class, and work through the case studies of three nineteenth-century utopian communities: Transcendentalist Brook Farm, the Harmony Society, and the Oneida Community. By looking at the networks of bodies, spaces, objects, and discourses that defined women’s work in these distinct communities, Smith reveals how labor was not only gendered but also raced and classed. These communities offer evidence of how industrialization differentiated labor across gender, class, and race and what gender reforms were thinkable in the mid-nineteenth century. This innovative rhetorical history advances valuable lessons for contemporary discussions in the discipline of teleological rhetorics, rhetorics of exceptionalism, and rhetorics of choice."

At a time of desperate scarcity, Torgsin had access to the country's best foodstuffs and goods. Initially, only foreigners were allowed to shop in Torgsin, but the acute demand for hard-currency revenues forced Stalin to open Torgsin to Soviet citizens who could exchange tsarist gold coins and objects made of precious metals and gemstones, as well as foreign monies, for foods and goods in its shops. Through her analysis of the large-scale, state-run entrepreneurship represented by Torgsin, Elena Osokina highlights the complexity and contradictions of Stalinism."

Quinlan follows how medical ideas, stemming from the birth of the clinic, zigzagged across the intellectual landscape of the French Revolution and its aftermath. It was a remarkable ""hotspot"" in the historical timeline, when doctors and scientists pioneered a staggering number of fields—from forensic investigation to evolutionary biology—and their innovations captivated the public imagination. During the 1790s and beyond, medicine left the somber halls of universities and hospitals to become profoundly politicized, inspiring a whole panoply of subcultures. In reconstructing this labyrinthine medical underworld, Quinlan argues that the place and authority of medical science evolved, in part, out of an attempt to redress the dislocation produced by the French Revolution."

Dutch merchants, officers, sailors, and soldiers found in their faith an ideology and justification for mercantile and martial activities. The West India Company supported the Reformed Church financially in Europe and helped spread Calvinism to other continents, while Calvinist employees and colonists benefitted from the familiar aspects of religious instruction and public worship. Yet the church-company union also encouraged destructive military operations against Catholic enemies abroad and divisive campaigns against sinners and religious nonconformers in colonial courts."

Drawing on hundreds of Spanish- and Portuguese-language documents; on interviews and correspondence with composers who either knew or worked with Copland during his 1963 tour; and on Copland’s diaries, this project sheds new light on the composer’s biography, the reception of his music worldwide, and U.S.-Latin American relations as enacted via the broader narrative of cultural diplomacy and its policy agendas."

Edmund Goehring's Coming to Terms with Our Musical Past offers an alternative vision of Mozart's works and of Western art music generally: such works as Mozart's radiate an idealism that has human sociability both as its source and its object. This fascinating 2018 book-length essay is addressed to any reader interested in the performing arts, visual arts, and literature and their relationship to the broader culture."

The book significantly expands our understanding of Rochberg's creative work by reconstructing and examining the earliest seeds of his aesthetic thinking--which took root while he served in Patton's Third Army--and following their development through his mature compositional period into the final stages of his long career. It argues that Rochberg's military service was a transformative life experience for the young humanist, one that crucially shaped his worldview and influenced his artistic creativity for the next sixty years. As such it reveals personal trauma and aesthetic recovery to be the basis of Rochberg's postwar ideas about humanism, musical quotation, and neotonality."

Ariela Marcus-Sells focuses on the scholars known as the Kunta who rose to prominence in the Western Sahara Desert in the late eighteenth century. The book shows how their prolific Arabic writings and pedagogical networks decisively influenced the development of Sufi Muslim though in West Africa. These scholars rose to prominence under the leadership of Sidi al-Mukhtar al-Kunti (d.1811). First Sidi al-Mukhtar, and then his son, Sidi Muhammad (d. 1826), established a vast pedagogical network; they produced prolific manuscript texts covering the breadth of the classical Islamic disciplines; and argued for their social authority as Sufi friends of God. Marcus-Sells demonstrates that the Kunta scholars understood human life as governed by the overlapping forces of the material, visible world and a vast invisible realm that both surrounds and interpenetrates with the world of the senses. These theologians presented and provided explicit instructions for practice."

State University seeks a Chair’s Grant to support conservation treatment and preservation framing of four artworks recovered from the Intermountain Intertribal
Boarding School (1950–1982). Begun in Brigham
City, Utah, as the Intermountain Indian School, a federally run boarding school for Navajo children,
the institution expanded to include students from multiple tribes and became the largest boarding school for Native Americans in the United
States, at one point enrolling more than 3,000 students. The four artworks, believed
to have been created by students, are the highest priority of twelve that
were cut from walls and doors prior to the demolition of several buildings and
stored without security or climate control. They convey aspects of students’ tribal cultures and depict landscapes, wildlife, and tribal regalia and ceremonies. The university plans to commit more funding to this work and to
fundraise for the conservation of the remaining artworks, as well as to support exhibition and related programming."

In 2023, the theme for Question Everything is Freedom and Liberty, and our participants will think deeply about what it means to be free, what it means to live freely in a democratic society, and what that freedom requires. Moreover, this theme reflects the values that the humanities are meant to safeguard and develop, and is extremely well-suited to a philosophy program, where freedom and liberty can be examined under a number of different guises: political, social, economic, psychological, and even metaphysical."
